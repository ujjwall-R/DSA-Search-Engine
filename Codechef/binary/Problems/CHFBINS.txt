Chef's wife is fan of Binary numbers. One day she gave him a bag having N strings of length N. All the strings are binary i.e. made up of 1's and 0's only. All the strings in the bag can be generated by a string S by simply performing right rotations N times. For example if S is "101", then the strings in the bag will be "110", "011", "101". Now Chef's wife wants to know the number of ways of selecting one string from the bag with an odd decimal equivalent. Chef got very confused by all this, so he asked for your help..

Input



			The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
		


		The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the length of the binary string.
	

		The second line of each test case contains a string of binary numbers.
	


Output


		For each test output a single line containing ansewer.
	

Constraints


1 ≤ T ≤ 103


1 ≤ N ≤ 105


Example
Input:
	
1 
2 
10 
Output:
1

Explanation
Given binary string : "10", we need to rotate the string right 2 times. 
Rotating Right : "01", Decimal Equivalent = 1 
Rotating Right : "10", Decimal Equivalent = 2 
Clearly there is only one way to select a string having odd decimal equivalent
