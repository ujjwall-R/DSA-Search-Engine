You are given two binary strings AA and BB, each with length NN. You may reorder the characters of AA in an arbitrary way and reorder the characters of BB also in an arbitrary (not necessarily the same) way. Then, you should compute the XOR of the resulting strings. Find the number of distinct values of this XOR which can be obtained, modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+7109+7).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains a single string AA with length NN.
The third line contains a single string BB with length NN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of unique XORs modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.

Explanation
Example case 1: The characters in each string can be reordered in two ways (swap them or do nothing), so there are four values of their XOR:

"00" XOR "10" is "10"
"00" XOR "01" is "01"
"00" XOR "10" is "10"
"00" XOR "01" is "01"

There are only two distinct values.
