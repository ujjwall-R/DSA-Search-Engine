Ants have developed advanced ways to find, distribute and make their own food, to such extent that, it has been said that ants eat more meat than lions wolves and tigers combined!
Argentine ant is one of the world’s worst invasive species(Species which are not native to a specific location, but have tendency to spread to a degree to cause damage to the native 
species of a region) present in the Norfolk Island. It forms supercolonies and are aggressive competitors, displacing most other ant species. It can alter ecosystem processes such as 
pollination and seed dispersal of native plant species.
The federal environment department is in its mission to wipe out the species from  Norfolk Island. So, they are carrying out a survey in T sites within the island examinig the 
food sources. They know that the ant species can survive in a site only if the food available is more than K units or else they will eventually die out from the site. For every site, 
they go around the region examining N food sources, and finding A[i], the unit of food available from the ith source(1 ≤ i ≤ N).

Determine for each site, whether the ant species can survive or they die out from the specific site.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers T and K. Then, information of T sites of the island follow.
For each T, the first line contains N, the number of food sources and the second line contains N space-separated integers, A[i] (1 ≤ i 
≤ N).


Output
For each T, output "SUCCESS" without quotes, if the ant species die out or "FAILURE" if the ant species survives.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ K ≤ 1018
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1013


Example Input
3 7
2
4 4
5
1 8 6 4 5

Example Output
FAILURE
FAILURE
SUCCESS



Example case 1:In the region the total food available is 8 units. So the ants survive.

Given an array AA consisting of NN non-negative integers. 
You need to perform the following operation (N−1)(N−1) times:

Sort the array A in ascending order.
Let M be the current size of the array A. Replace the array A by [(A2−A1),(A3−A2),…,(AM−AM−1)]. Note that each time the operation is performed, the size of the array reduces by one.

Find the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, output single line: the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤1018
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

                        Sample Output 1
                        





1
777


Explanation

Test case 1: The operations look like:
Operation 1: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [0,3,19,29]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(3−0),(19−3),(29−19)]=[3,16,10].
Operation 2: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [3,10,16]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(10−3),(16−10)]=[7,6].
Operation 3: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [6,7]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(7−6)]=[1].

Thus, the remaining element after 3 operations is 1.

Test case 2: Since N=1, you don't need to perform any operation. The remaining element after 0 operations is 777.

Finally the LazyProblemSetters have decided the way in which they will attempt the questions in the problem set. They have decided to go to the Computer Lab of the CSE department (because it has air-conditioning) and are ready to get their hands dirty with some WA's and TLE's.

Their department has a very unique lab. They have a lot of computers and each student gets a private account which they can access through any of those computers. For this, no data is stored on these computers but on dedicated servers and sent to the computer that a student is currently using. This way the students are not forced to sit on particular computers and can choose any place they like that is available.

Now, the department has a home built advanced facial recognition software which they use in this lab. It works as follows:When anyone sits on a computer, his/her picture is captured, (along with the locality) and sent to the internal database of the lab where they identify the user associated with that picture, and the computer he/she is sitting. After that the data of that user is fetched from the dedicated data servers and sent to the computer.

Now, all this takes time, and to keep the user busy, they decided to give them a puzzle to solve. If the user solves the puzzle correctly, they are allowed to login. The puzzle is as follows:


 A string S (composed of only small case letters of the English alphabet) is shown on the screen to the user.
 Then two integers P and Q are shown to the users. 
 The user has now to create a string R using S and P by concatenating P copies of S one after another.
Then R is transformed into its smallest lexicographic permutation i.e. all the "a"'s are brought to the front and placed there, then after that all the "b"'s are placed, then "c"'s and so on. This is the final R that the user needs to form.
 Then Q numbers appear on the screen one by one. For each number N that appears on the screen, the user has to type the character at the Nth location of R. If N is greater than the length of R, they have to type "-1" (without quotes).


Input
The first line consists of an integer T, the number of test cases followed by the test cases themselves. 
Each test case begins with the string S in the first line, followed by two space-separated integers P and Q in the next line. 
Then Q lines follow, each containing an integer N.

Output
For each test case, for each integer N, print in a new line the character at the Nth location of R  or print "-1" (without quotes) as described above. 
Constraints

 1 ≤ P ≤ 107 
 1 ≤ N ≤ 109 
 1 ≤ Q ≤ 105 
 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100, where |S| denotes the length of the string. 
 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 

Example
Input:
1
abcde
3 5
3
4
10
15
16

Output:
a
b
d
e
-1

Note: Large I/O, be careful with certain languages

Chef has a large integer and for storing it he has used an integer array named digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Chef wants to increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the length of the array.
The next line contains N space-separated integers D1,D2,…,DN, denoting the given array.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers of the resulting array.
Constraints

1 <= digits.length <= 100
0 <= digits[i] <= 9
digits does not contain any leading 0's.

1 0


Explanation
first array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
second array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
third array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an array A, consisting of N integers and an array B, consisting of M integers.
The subsequence of A is the array that can be obtained by picking the elements at the arbitrary sorted set of positions from A.
Your task is to count the number of such subsequences C of A that:

C contains exactly M elements.
The array (C+B) is non-decreasing. Here by + operation, we mean element-wise sum. 
For example, the array (4, 8, 5) plus the array (10, 20, 30) is (14, 28, 35).
Formally, (C+B) is an array of size M such that (C+B)i = Ci + Bi.


In case some subsequence appears more that once, you should counts it as many times as it appears.
Formally, two subarrays of an array a, (ai_1, ai_2, ... ,ai_n) and (aj_1, aj_2, ... ,aj_m) will be considered different if either their lengths are different i.e. n != m or there exists an index k such that such that i_k  != j_k.

Since the answer can be very large, we ask you to calculate it, modulo 109+7.
Input
The first line of input contains a pair of space separated integers N and M, denoting the number of elements in the array A and the number of elements in the array B.
The second line contains N space-separated integers Ai, denoting the array A.
The third line contains M space-separated integers Bj, denoting the array B.
Output
Output a single line containing the number of subsequences C as asked in the problem, modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 109
1 ≤ M ≤ N

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (33 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, 1 ≤ M ≤ 5
Subtask #2 (33 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 500, 1 ≤ M ≤ 50
Subtask #3 (34 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000

Example
Input #1:
5 3
1 5 2 4 7
7 9 6

Output #1:
4

Input #2:
4 2
7 7 7 7
3 4

Output #2:
6

Explanation
Example case 1. The suitable subsequences are (1, 2, 7), (1, 4, 7), (5, 4, 7), (2, 4, 7).
Example case 2. The suitable subsequence is (7, 7), and it appears 6 times:

at indices (1, 2)
at indices (1, 3)
at indices (1, 4)
at indices (2, 3)
at indices (2, 4)
at indices (3, 4)


So, the answer is 6.

Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an integer sequence AA with length NN.
Find the number of (unordered) pairs of elements such that the average of these two elements is also present in the sequence. Formally, find the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N and there is an index k (1≤k≤N) for which 2Ak=Ai+Aj holds.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid pairs (i,j).
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
|Ai|≤103 for each valid i

Explanation
Example case 1: We can take k for Ak to be either 1 or 2, since Ak=2 either way. Since the problem asks for unordered pairs, (1,2) is the only possible valid pair (the same as (2,1)). Hence, the answer is 1.
Example case 2: We see that A1=2=(1+3)/2. No other valid pair exists.

Agent Chef 
RAW (Indian spy agency) hacked into a terrorist computer which according to 
their intelligence contains information about future terrorist attacks. But there is
a problem that the computer uses a particular encryption technique to safeguard its 
data. That computer gives a token, which consists of space separated elements. These 
elements are numbers each ranging from 0 to 9. It is known this encryption can be broken 
by constructing a number with the given elements in the order given by the computer and
adding the reverse of that number to the original number. The sum so obtained is the key
to break the encryption. This mission to construct the decryption device has been given to
agent Chef. Help the Chef construct this device. 
Input Format: 
First line contains an integer T, representing no. of test cases.
For each of test cases:
First line contains an integer N, representing size of token.
Second line contains N elements of token that are space separated.

Output Format: 
For each test case output will be a token of space separated elements.
Constraints: 
T <= 20
1 <= N <= 1000 
Each element will be a number from 0 to 9
Examples: 
Input
2
6
2 1 4 2 6 7
5
1 3 2 8 0
Output
9 7 6 6 7 9
2 1 5 1 1
Explanation:
First line gives T=2 (2 test cases). 6 in next line means there will be 6 elements in the 
token and the next line has the token itself. Output is 9 7 6 6 7 9 as 214267+762412=976679.
 Similarly, 13280+08231=21511 for the second test case.

Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
In Chefland, types of ingredients are represented by integers and recipes are represented by sequences of ingredients that are used when cooking. One day, Chef found a recipe represented by a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN at his front door and he is wondering if this recipe was prepared by him.
Chef is a very picky person. He uses one ingredient jar for each type of ingredient and when he stops using a jar, he does not want to use it again later while preparing the same recipe, so ingredients of each type (which is used in his recipe) always appear as a contiguous subsequence. Chef is innovative, too, so he makes sure that in each of his recipes, the quantity of each ingredient (i.e. the number of occurrences of this type of ingredient) is unique ― distinct from the quantities of all other ingredients.
Determine whether Chef could have prepared the given recipe.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the recipe could have been prepared by Chef or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤103
1≤Ai≤103 for each valid i

                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES
NO
NO


Explanation
Example case 1: For each ingredient type, its ingredient jar is used only once and the quantities of all ingredients are pairwise distinct. Hence, this recipe could have been prepared by Chef. 
Example case 2: The jar of ingredient 4 is used twice in the recipe, so it was not prepared by Chef.

The range of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value in it.
Chef comes up with a crazy idea to minimize the range by changing atmost 33 elements in the array. He wants to check whether the minimum range he gets is right or not.
Please help him in verifying his answer.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each test case contains an integer NN, the no. of integers in the array.
Second line contains N space separated integers, A0,A1,...,An−1. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the minimum range.
Constraints

EXPLANATION:
Chef changes the elements 3, 5 and 10 to 0, 1 and 2, resulting in the array: [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0].
The minimum range is 2−0=2. There can be multiple ways to change atmost 3 elements to get the answer.

Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
There are NN workers; each worker is of one of the following three types:

A translator translates some text from Chef's language to another langague.
An author writes some text in Chef's language.
An author-translator can both write a text in Chef's language and translate it to another language.

Chef wants to have some text written and translated into some language (different from Chef's language). Chef can't do either of those tasks, but he can hire workers. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), if he hires the ii-th worker, he must pay that worker cici coins.
Help Chef find the minimum total number of coins he needs to pay to have a text written and translated. It is guaranteed that it is possible to write and translate a text.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN denoting the number of workers.
The second line contins NN space-separated integers c1,c2,...,cNc1,c2,...,cN denoting the numbers of coins Chef has to pay each hired worker.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers t1,t2,...,tNt1,t2,...,tN denoting the types of workers. For each valid ii, the ii-th worker is a translator if ti=1ti=1, an author if ti=2ti=2 or an author-translator if ti=3ti=3.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of coins Chef has to pay.

One day Chef and his friend Alice decide to build a device which will transfer the data between them. The data is transferred in binary form i.e. 1 & 0. 
When the device was built they tried to test it. While testing the device they found out that due to noise in the data transferring channel they didn’t receive the 
data in exactly the same form, some of the digits of the data were misplaced or missing. So Chef and Alice decided that chef will fine tune the device and send the 
same data to Alice for N number of times and the data with lowest error will be accepted.

Your task is to help Alice find the ith sent data for which the minimum error is received.

Given that %error = (total no of wrong digits / total number of digits) × 100

Input

The first line of input contains two integer N denoting the numbers of times the data was sent and L denoting the length of the data sent. 
The second line contains the correct data which is to be transferred.
Each of the following  N  lines contain the data sent by the device in the ith attempt.


Output
Output a single line containing the string which has the lowest error.
Note:If there are more than one possible output with the same minimum error then output the first string which has the minimum error.


Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 103
1 ≤ L ≤ 103

One day Chef's friend gave him a sequence a1,a2,a3,a4.....an. He told Chef to find the length of the longest appearing 
Even Sequence. An even sequence is a sequence formed with only consecutive even numbers(e.g. 4 8 2 14 is an even sequence but 4 8 5 14 is not). But the twist is that firstly 
he wants Chef to convert the sequence in a specified form where b1>= b2<=b3 >=b4<=.......... upto n terms and then find the length 
of the longest appearing Even Sequence.
NOTE: If there are multiple sequence possible, take the one that's lexicographically smallest.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer N denoting the numbers of Test Cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of element in the Sequence. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the sequence.


Output
output a single line containing the length of the longest appearing Even Sequence.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105


Example Input
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
6 7 8 10 12 16


Example Output
1
5


Explanation
Example case 1:The given sequence can be converted to 2 1 4 3 5, 5 2 3 1 4 etc.. but we'll take the lexicographically smallest one i.e. 2 1 4 3 5.  
Now we can see the longest appearing Even Sequence in the new sequence is 1.
Example case 2:Similarly as case 1 the lexicographically smallest sequence is 7 6 10 8 16 12 and the lenght of the longest appearing Even sequence is 5.

Chef recently graduated Computer Science in university, so he was looking for a job. He applied for several job offers, but he eventually settled for a software engineering job at ShareChat. Chef was very enthusiastic about his new job and the first mission assigned to him was to implement a message encoding feature to ensure the chat is private and secure.


Chef has a message, which is a string S with length N containing only lowercase English letters. It should be encoded in two steps as follows:

Swap the first and second character of the string S, then swap the 3rd and 4th character, then the 5th and 6th character and so on. If the length of S is odd, the last character should not be swapped with any other.

Replace each occurrence of the letter 'a' in the message obtained after the first step by the letter 'z', each occurrence of 'b' by 'y', each occurrence of 'c' by 'x', etc, and each occurrence of 'z' in the message obtained after the first step by 'a'.



The string produced in the second step is the encoded message. Help Chef and find this message.


Input:


The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.


The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.

The second line contains the message string S.



Output:

For each test case, print a single line containing one string — the encoded message.


Constraints:
1≤T≤1,000

1≤N≤100

|S|=N

S contains only lowercase English letters


Sample Input:

2

9

sharechat

4

chef

Sample Output:
shizxvzsg

sxuv

EXPLANATION:
Example case 1: The original message is "sharechat". In the first step, we swap four pairs of letters (note that the last letter is not swapped), so it becomes "hsraceaht". In the second step, we replace the first letter ('h') by 's', the second letter ('s') by 'h', and so on, so the resulting encoded message is "shizxvzsg".

Saurabh loves to climb mountains, but he climbs the mountain only when the height of the mountains are in increasing order. Now he decided to climb the mountains, but it may be possible that the height of the mountains is not in increasing order.
There are NN mountains, whose heights are H[1],H[2],H[3],...,H[N]H[1],H[2],H[3],...,H[N]. But before climbing the mountains he has to arrange the height of mountains in increasing order.
For doing this he can swap the heights of any two adjacent mountains i.e. H[i]H[i] and H[i+1].
In swapping, the height of H[i] decreases by 1 while the height of H[i+1] increases by 1. This operation can be applied any number of times he wants. Can you help him to find the final sorted order of mountains so that he can climb the mountains?
Input:

The First-line contains an integer N, denoting the number of mountains.
The Second line contains N space-separated integers representing the height of mountains.

Output:
If it is possible to arrange the height of mountains in increasing order, then Print “YES” and Print the sorted height of mountains in the next line. Else Print “NO”.
Constraints

1<=N<=105
1<=H[i]<=105

Sample Input:
5
7 3 9 6 10

Sample Output:
YES
4 6 7 8 10

EXPLANATION:
In the given example [7,3,9,6,10],
he will swap 7 and 3 changing the value of 7 to 6 and 3 to 4, now the heights are [4, 6, 9, 6, 10] and 
Again, he will swap 9 and 6 changing the value of 9 to 8 and 6 to 7, now the heights are [4, 6, 7, 8, 10]. The heights are in Increasing Order.

Arya's birthday is here and he has received many gifts. He has received a total of N gifts from his N friends. Each of these friends has gifted him with K numbers.


Now, for each of these gifts he received, Arya has calculated the XOR of all the numbers in the i-th gift.

Furthermore, he found the bitwise AND, S of all these XOR values.
Since he hates being the center of attention in a party, he has decided to minimize the value of S. However, so as not to seem rude, he can only toggle at most one bit at any position of a number in any gift that he recieved.

Since, Arya is busy managing his guests, he needs your help to find the minimum value of S.

 
Input
The first lint contains T,the number of test cases.
The first line of each test cases contains two space separated integers, N and K.
The subsequent N lines contain K space separated integers G[i] denoting each number gifted by that friend.


 
Output
Print T lines, where each line contains the answer to the corresponding test case.

Constraints
1 ≤ T≤ 1000 
1 ≤ N,K≤ 1000 
1 ≤ G[i]≤ (2^10)-1
 
Example
Input:

1
2 2
1 2
3 4


Output:

1

 
Explanation
Example case 1.

XOR of all values in the first row: 3

XOR of all values in the second row: 7


On toggling the 2nd (from the right) bit of the first gift of the first friend, the minimum answer is received.


XOR of all values in the first row: 1

XOR of all values in the second row: 7

Shini has n toys on the shelf of her room. Each of her Toys have a name. When she tried to arrange them in 
alphabetical order, she realized that the names of all her toys start with either K,M or L. If Shini arranges
 all her toys in a random order (not in the alphabetical order) then find the least number of her toys that
 can be taken off the shelf so that no two adjacent toys have names starting with the same letter.

 
Input
The first lint contains T,the number of test cases.
The first line of each test cases contains integer n — the number of toys on the shelf.
The next line contains string s, which represents the first letter of each toy in order. We'll consider
 the toys in the row numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Then the i-th character s equals "K", if th
 e i-th toy's name starts with K, "L", if it starts with L and "M", if it starts with M. 

 
Output
For each test cases print a single integer — the answer to the problem 
Constraints
1 ≤ T≤ 1000 
1 ≤ N≤ 100000 
 
Example
Input:

1
5
MLLKL

Output:

1

 
Explanation
Example case 1.
In the given test case there are two adjacent toys whose names start with L. If any one of
 those toys are removed then it is seen that the order of toys is MLKL and hence no two adjacent toys have the same name.

Explanation
In the first test case since we have only 2 flavors,flavor 1 is occuring 3 times and 2 is occuring 2 times.
The maximum subsegment of pastries is of flavor 1 which is 3.
In the second case we have 5 pastries and 3 flavors but the third flavor is not in the list hence whole array is valid answer.

Our Chef is hosting a cooking competition in which only two teams can compete at the same time. Both sides should have an equal number of participants to make the competition engaging and fair. Chef was given the duty of forming the two teams as an organizer.
There are various conditions for forming teams. He will be assigned a number 'N' for each competition, and for each divisor 'D' of 'N' (including 1 and 'N' itself), he will add a member:
1) If 'D' is even, go to the first team.
2) if 'D' is odd, go to the second team.
Chef needs your assistance with the event planning because he is quite busy. Your job is to advise the chef whether or not he can make two teams with the same amount of members.
For Example:
For ‘N’ = 10,
The divisors are:
1, 2, 5, 10.
The first team will have two members corresponding to even divisors 2 and 10.
The second team will have two members corresponding to odd divisors 1 and 5.
So, in this case, Chef can make two teams.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the number given to Chef.

Output Format
For each test case print 1 if Chef can make two teams of equal members with the given ‘N’, else print 0.
Output for each test case will be printed in a separate line.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases doesn’t exceed 10^5.

Explanation
In test case 1:
N = 7, the divisors of 7 are 1,7.
The first team will have 0 members since there are no even divisors.
The second team will have 2 members corresponding to divisors 1 and 7.
Since the teams have a different number of members, the output will be 0.
In test case 2:
N=14, the divisors of 14 are 1,2,7,14.
The first team will have 2 members corresponding to divisors 2 and 14.
The second team will have 2 members corresponding to divisors 1 and 7.
Since the teams have the same number of members, the output will be 1.

A thermal decomposition reaction is breakdown of a compound into one or more compounds when heated.
For example, P→a⋅Q+b⋅R is a decomposition reaction. Here, 1 unit of P is converted into a unit of Q and b unit of R after completion of the reaction.
You are given N compounds numbered from 1 to N. The initial amount of the ith compound is Qi. 
You are also given M equations. Every equation is of the form: 
C0→W1⋅C1+W2⋅C2+…+WX⋅CX.
Here:

C0 represents the compound which will decompose into X compounds on heating.
Ci (1≤i≤X) represents the compounds into which C0 is decomposed.
Wi (1≤i≤X) represents the number of units of Ci produced due to the decomposition of C0.
Ci>Ci−1 for all (1≤i≤X).

Note that a compound can decompose in at most one way only.
Find the final amount of each compound after prolonged heating. Since the number can be huge, print the answer modulo 109+7.
Input Format

First line will contain two space separated integers N and M - the number of compounds and the number of equations.
Second line will contain N space separated integers Q1,Q2,...,QN - the initial amounts of each compound.
The next 2⋅M lines contain the details of the M equations.  Each equation is represented using 2 lines.
First line of the ith equation contains two space separated integers Ci,0, Xi - the decomposing compound and the number of compounds in which it decomposes.
Second line of the ith equation contains 2⋅Xi space separated integers Wi,1,Ci,1,Wi,2,Ci,2,…,Wi,Xi,Ci,Xi - the number of units and the types of compounds into which Ci,0 decomposes. 

Output Format
Print N lines. The ith line contains a single integer denoting the final amount of the ith compound after prolonged heating modulo 109+7.
Constraints

Explanation
Test Cse 1: We have 4 compounds initially. For better explanation, we refer the compounds 1,2,3, and 4 as A1,A2,A3, and A4 respectively. Initially, the amount of A1,A2,A3, and A4 present is 5,10,12, and 2 respectively.
The two equations are:

A1→3⋅A2+4⋅A3
A3→2⋅A4

We know that 1 unit of A1 produces 3 units of A2 and 4 units of A3. Thus, the initial 5 units of A1 decompose to 5⋅3=15 units of A2 and 5⋅4=20 units of A3. Note that now there are 0 units of A1 left.
Considering only this reaction, the updated amounts of chemicals would be [0,10+15,12+20,2]=[0,25,32,2].
We also know that 1 unit of A3 decomposes to 2 units of A4. The total amount of A3 available for decomposition would be 32 units (12 units were available initially and 20 units were formed due to decomposition). Thus these 32 units would produce 32⋅2=64 units of A4.
Thus, after prolonged heating, the amounts of compounds are [0,25,0,64+2]=[0,25,0,66].

Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
An encoder encodes the first 1616 lowercase English letters using 44 bits each. The first bit (from the left) of the code is 00 if the letter lies among the first 88 letters, else it is 11, signifying that it lies among the last 88 letters. The second bit of the code is 00 if the letter lies among the first 44 letters of those 88 letters found in the previous step, else it's 11, signifying that it lies among the last 44 letters of those 88 letters. Similarly, the third and the fourth bit each signify the half in which the letter lies. 
For example, the letter jj would be encoded as :

Among (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h || i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p)i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p), jj appears in the second half. So the first bit of its encoding is 11.
Now, among (i,j,k,l(i,j,k,l || m,n,o,p)m,n,o,p), jj appears in the first half. So the second bit of its encoding is 00.
Now, among (i,j(i,j || k,l)k,l), jj appears in the first half. So the third bit of its encoding is 00.
Now, among (i(i || j)j), jj appears in the second half. So the fourth and last bit of its encoding is 11.

So jj's encoding is 10011001,
Given a binary encoded string SS, of length at most 105105, decode the string. That is, the first 4 bits are the encoding of the first letter of the secret message, the next 4 bits encode the second letter, and so on. It is guaranteed that the string's length is a multiple of 4.
Input:

The first line of the input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, the length of the encoded string.
The second line of each test case contains the encoded string SS.

Output:
For each test case, print the decoded string, in a separate line.

Explanation

Sample Case 11 : 

The first bit is 00, so the letter lies among the first 88 letters, i.e., among a,b,c,d,e,f,g,ha,b,c,d,e,f,g,h. The second bit is 00, so it lies among the first four of these, i.e., among a,b,c,da,b,c,d. 
The third bit is 00, so it again lies in the first half, i.e., it's either aa or bb. Finally, the fourth bit is also 00, so we know that the letter is aa.

Sample Case 22 : 

Each four bits correspond to a character. Just like in sample case 11, 00000000 is equivalent to aa. Similarly, 11111111 is equivalent to pp. So, the decoded string is apap.

Sample Case 33 : 

The first bit is 11, so the letter lies among the last 88 letters, i.e., among i,j,k,l,m,n,o,pi,j,k,l,m,n,o,p. The second bit is 00, so it lies among the first four of these, i.e., among i,j,k,li,j,k,l. 
The third bit is 00, so it again lies in the first half, i.e., it's either ii or jj. Finally, the fourth bit is 11, so we know that the letter is jj.

Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
A battle is going to begin in the kingdom of Airland. There are N soldiers in the kingdom, numbered 1 through N and standing in a circle in such a way that for each valid i, the soldier directly to the right of the i-th soldier is soldier i+1, and the soldier directly to the right of the N-th soldier is soldier 1.
Each soldier holds a sword and a shield. The sword is used to attack other soldiers and the shield is used to defend from attacks. Let's denote the attack value of the i-th soldier's sword by ai and the defense value of the i-th soldier's shield by di.
In the battle, each soldier picks one of the soldiers standing to his left and right, and attacks that soldier. The choices of the soldiers are completely independent, so each soldier can be attacked by the soldier to his left, by the soldier to his right (the power of such an attack is the attack value of the attacking soldier's sword), by both of them (then, the power of the resulting attack is the sum of the attack values of these soldiers' swords) or by nobody. A soldier remains alive if the defense value of his shield is strictly greater than the power with which he is attacked. Everyone attacks simultaneously and there is only one round of attacks. Each soldier that remains alive at the end is awarded a laurel.
The king of Airland likes these fights, so the host of the battle promised the king that he can pick one soldier and if the soldier he picks survives the battle, the king receives the shield of that soldier.
Chef is the deputy of the king and you want to help him pick a soldier for the king in such a way that the king receives the best shield (with the greatest defense value). However, if Chef picks a soldier and that soldier does not survive, Chef will be thrown in a snake pit. Therefore, it should be guaranteed that the chosen soldier will survive regardless of the decisions of the other soldiers.
Can you help Chef make the best choice and tell him the defense value of the shield which the king gets, or decide that he can be thrown in the snake pit no matter which soldier he picks?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers d1,d2,…,dN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the best defense value of the shield the king gets, or −1 if Chef can be thrown in the snake pit.

Explanation
Example case 1: Soldier 1 can be attacked by soldier 2 and/or soldier 4. If only soldier 2 attacks him, the power of the attack is 1. If only soldier 4 attacks him, the power of the attack is 1 again. If they attack together, the power of the attack is 2. In each of these cases, soldier 1 will live.
Soldier 2 can be attacked by soldier 3, with attack power 4. His shield has defense value 4, which is not enough, so in this case, soldier 2 would die. The best safe choice is soldier 1, with defense value 3.
Example case 2: No soldier is guaranteed to survive the battle, so the answer is −1.

Chef was recently watching Modi Ji's speech and he had a perfect array of integers with him. A perfect array is one in which sum of odd index elements equals the sum of even index elements.
As soon as Modi Ji announced the lockdown, he was shocked and lost one of the elements in the array. So, it is quite possible that the array is no longer perfect.
He needs your help. You are given an array of N integers. You need to add exactly one integer in the beginning of the array so that it becomes perfect.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of test case contains an integer N.
Next line contains N space seperated integers, A0, A1, … , An−1.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the integer value to be added at the beginning of the array.

EXPLANATION:
In case 1, after adding −2 at 0th index, the array becomes: [−2, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The sum of odd and even index elements are both equal to 4 now.

Numeros the Artist had two lists that were permutations of one another. He was very proud. Unfortunately, while transporting them from one exhibition to another, some numbers were lost out of the first list. Can you find the missing numbers?
As an example, the array with some numbers missing, arr=[7,2,5,3,5,3]arr=[7,2,5,3,5,3]. The original array of numbers brr=[7,2,5,4,6,3,5,3]brr=[7,2,5,4,6,3,5,3]. The numbers missing are [4,6][4,6].
Notes:

If a number occurs multiple times in the lists, you must ensure that the frequency of that number in both lists is the same. If that is not the case, then it is also a missing number.
You have to print all the missing numbers in ascending order.
Print each missing number once, even if it is missing multiple times.
The difference between the maximum and minimum number in the second list is less than or equal to 100.
arr: the array with missing numbers
brr: the original array of numbers

Input:
There will be four lines of input:

n, the size of the first list, arr.
The next line contains  n space-separated integers arr[i].
m, the size of the second list, brr.
The next line contains  m space-separated integers brr[i].

Output:
Output the missing numbers in ascending order separated by space.

EXPLANATION:
204 is present in both arrays. Its frequency in  arr is 2, while its frequency in brr  is 3. Similarly,  205 and  206 occur twice in arr, but three times in brr. The rest of the numbers have the same frequencies in both lists.

Park Street in Kolkata is famous for its mouth watering sweets. There are a total of N  shops in the market, which are extended over a single street with shops following one another. The shops are enumerated from 1 to N, from left to right. The market is unique in the sense that each shop sells only a single type of sweet. Additionally, no two shops sell the same type of sweet. For convenience, the different types of sweets are numbered from 1 to N.
Though the famous market has been running smoothly for many years, the city Mayor decided to have it completely overhauled and aims to make this famous market great again. So he has issued a tender for the shops, which you happened to grab by using your good offices with the Mayor. The tender specifies that you should decide which type of sweet each shop should sell. You would like to do so, while keeping in mind that buyers like purchasing sweets if adjacent shops sell sweets of similar types, because then they can purchase similar type sweets without wandering around many shops. Formally, you would like to minimize the maximum absolute value of difference between the types of sweets in adjacent shops. Two shops which are numbered i and i + 1 (i < N) are said to be adjacent to each other.
The city Mayor himself is very fond of sweets and has decided to have his own shop in the market too. He has chosen shop numbered S in which he will sell sweets of type Q. For the remaining N - 1 shops, you have to assign which sweets should be sold so as to minimize the maximum absolute difference in the type of sweets in adjacent shops.
Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains three space separated integers N, S, Q, denoting number of shops in the market, the shop chosen by the Mayor, and the type of sweet the Mayor's shop sells, respectively.
Output
For each test case, output two lines.
In the first line of each test case, output the minimum value of the maximum difference in the types of sweets of adjacent shops.
In the next line, output N space separated integers denoting the types of sweets sold in each of the shops. If there are multiple answers, output any one.
Constraints

1 ≤ T, N ≤ 500
1 ≤ S, Q ≤ N

Example
Input:
2
3 2 3
2 1 1

Output:
2
1 3 2
1
1 2

Explanation
Example case 1.The city Mayor has decided to sell sweets of type 3 in the second shop. In the first shop, you can decide to sell sweets of type 1 and that of type 2 in the third shop. In this case, maximum difference in the type of sweets of adjacent shops is 2. There can be one other way of assigning sweets with shops, i.e. sell sweets of type 2 in shop 1 and that of type 1 in shop 3. In this case also, maximum difference in type of adjacent shops is 2. So, you can see that in any case, minimum value of maximum difference in type of adjacent shops will be 2. Hence answer is 2.

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
There are N students living in the dormitory of Berland State University. Each of them sometimes wants to use the kitchen, so the head of the dormitory came up with a timetable for kitchen's usage in order to avoid the conflicts:

The first student starts to use the kitchen at the time 0 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A1.
The second student starts to use the kitchen at the time A1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A2.
And so on.
The N-th student starts to use the kitchen at the time AN-1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time AN


The holidays in Berland are approaching, so today each of these N students wants to cook some pancakes. The i-th student needs Bi units of time to cook.
The students have understood that probably not all of them will be able to cook everything they want. How many students will be able to cook without violating the schedule?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of students.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the moments of time by when the corresponding student should finish cooking. 
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BN denoting the time required for each of the students to cook.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of students that will be able to finish the cooking.
Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
0 < A1 <  A2 < ... < AN < 109
1 ≤ Bi ≤ 109

Example
Input:
2
3
1 10 15
1 10 3
3
10 20 30
15 5 20

Output:
2
1

Explanation
Example case 1. The first student has 1 unit of time - the moment 0. It will be enough for her to cook. The second student has 9 units of time, but wants to cook for 10 units of time, and won't fit in time. The third student has 5 units of time and will fit in time, because needs to cook only for 3 units of time.
Example case 2. Each of students has 10 units of time, but only the second one will be able to fit in time.

An operation on an array of size nn shifts each of the array's elements 11 unit to the left. For example, if  22 operations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].   
Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d operations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers. 
Input Format:
The    first   line    contains    two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and d (the number of operations you must perform). 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state. 
Constraints:

1≤n≤105 
1≤d≤n 
1≤ai≤106 where ai is the ith element of array   

Output Format:
Print a single    line    of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d operations. 
Sample Input:
5 4
1 2 3 4 5   
Sample Output:
5 1 2 3 4
Explanation:
When we perform d=4 operations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:   
[1,2,3,4,5]→[2,3,4,5,1]→[3,4,5,1,2]→[4,5,1,2,3]→[5,1,2,3,4] 
Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated    values,
which is 5 1 2 3 4.

A Little Elephant and his friends from the Zoo of Lviv like candies very much.

There are N elephants in the Zoo. The elephant with number K (1 ≤ K ≤ N) will be happy if he receives at least AK candies. There are C candies in all in the Zoo.

The Zoo staff is interested in knowing whether it is possible to make all the N elephants happy by giving each elephant at least as many candies as he wants, that is, the Kth elephant should receive at least AK candies. Each candy can be given to only one elephant. Print Yes if it is possible and No otherwise.

Input
The first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and C, the total number of elephants and the total number of candies in the Zoo respectively. The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.

Output
For each test case output exactly one line containing the string Yes if it possible to make all elephants happy and the string No otherwise. Output is case sensitive. So do not print YES or yes.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ C ≤ 109
1 ≤ AK ≤ 10000, for K = 1, 2, ..., N

Yes
No


Explanation
Case 1. We can give one candy to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant and make them both happy. Hence the answer is Yes. Alternatively we can give one candy to each elephant and left one candy for ourselves but they again will be happy.

Case 2. Even if we give four candies to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant we will have only one candy left and can not make last elephant happy since he needs two candies for his happiness. Hence the answer is No.

Once Chef was going through the stuff he has in his basement and to his surprise he found N metal balls, each with different weight. Our Chef who is always searching for a way to earn money has decided to sell these balls to gain free money. To his luck, he has found a dealer who is ready to buy these balls but the dealer has agreed to buy only M number of balls. The dealer has also told Chef that lesser the difference between minimum and maximum weigth of metal balls, more money he gets.
Help Chef find M metal balls that he has to give to the dealer to gain Maximum money.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N which denotes number of metal balls.
Second line of each test case contains N space-seperated numbers that denote weight of each ball.
Third line of each test case contains a single integer N which denotes number of metal balls that the dealer want to buy 

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <=N<= 107
1 <= A[i]<= 1018
1 <= M <= N

Output:
For each test case, print a single integer denoting minimum difference that can be achieved.
Sample Input:
 2
 9
 12 8 4 15 7 1 16 14 11
 5
 7
 1 1 2 19 13 1 4
 4

Sample Output:
 5
 1

Explanation:
  Test Case 1:  If we consider 5 metal balls of weights [12, 15, 16, 14, 11] , the minimum 
  difference between minimum and maximum weights is 16-11 = 5. So the final answer is 5.

  Test Case 2: If we consider 4 metal balls of weights [1, 1, 2, 1] , the minimum 
  difference between minimum and maximum weights is 2-1 = 1. So the final answer is 1.

Chef is playing with balls of two colours one red and another green.There is a machine named "Chef Game Machine" in which all the balls are kept. Chef Game Machine is having a button which when press, it shuffles and puts all the balls in a row(numbered from 1 to N).One row will contain only one ball.Let's denote red ball with '1' and green ball with '0'.
Game is that one need to find the maximum contiguous length of red balls by replacing at most one green ball in the row after shuffling. Chef can win the game if he finds the correct length of contiguous red balls by replacing at most one green ball
For example after shuffling the arrangement of ball is like this 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0  if you replace green ball at 7th place by red ball then you will get  1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 here maximun contiguous red ball length is 5(from index 5 to index 9 ). 

  Now Chef wants to win every time so he ask you to find the longest contiguous  red balls length after replacing one green ball the row.

 Note : You may or may not replace green ball. 

Input  

 First line of test case will contains T, number of test cases. T lines follows. 
 First line of every test case will contain the length N of the row. 
 Second line will contains N space separated 1s and 0s.
 

 Output  

 Output will print a single integer denoting the maximum contiguous length possible after replacing on green ball.

Chef has a non-decreasing array A of N elements. Since Chef was getting bored in his holidays, he was wondering how many subarrays exist in the array, such that the arithmetic mean (avergae) of the subarray is less than the integer K. As the number of such subarrays can be a lot, Chef is asking for your help to exhaust his curiosity. 

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. A single element is also considered a subarray. For example, [3], [4] and [3, 4, 5] are some of the subarrays of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Two subarrays are different if their start or/and end indices are different. 

 
Input
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers in non-decreasing order A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output
Output one integer, the number of subarrays who has mean strictly less than K. Note that this number exceed the maximum of what a C++ integer can hold. 


Subtasks

1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109 for all subtasks

Subtask 1(10 points): All numbers in the array are the same
Subtask 2(30 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 103, 1 ≤ K ≤ 103
Subtask 3(60 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 106, 1 ≤ K ≤ 109
 
Example
Input:
5 4
2 2 3 5 6 

Output:
9

 
Explanation
 The subarrays are: [2], [2], [3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Chef likes to play with array elements. His teacher has given him an array problem. But now he is busy as Christmas is coming. So, he needs your help. Can you help him to solve this problem.
You are given an array (A1,A2,A3……AN)(A1,A2,A3……AN) of length NN. You have to create an another array using the given array in the following ways:
For each valid i, the ith element of the output array will be the sum of the ith element and (A[i])th element if A[i]A[i] is less equal N.
Other wise for each valid i following the step below
i) Divide the value of A[i] by 2 untill it will be less thanN.
ii) then find the difference (D) between N and A[i].
iii) the ith element of the output array will be Dth element.  
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.  
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.   

Output:

For each testcase, print new array in each line.

John likes fighting games a lot. He owns a game called "Fight Club". In this game there are n players playing all the times. Every player has an energy level (Ai). Every day one of the following 2 things happen:

Either one of these players get an energy boost of X, now his energy level increases by X.
Or two players X and Y (with energy levels Ax and Ay) fight against each other and if some player is having energy level strictly greater than the other then he gets all the energy (Ax+Ay) and the energy level of the other player becomes 0. If they have equal energies then it's a draw and nothing happens.


The above game continues for d days. Now you have the information of what happened on each day.

1 i X : ith player gets an energy of X.
2 U V : means the player U and V fight against each other.

After every day you need to print the maximum energy level that any player has (Note that you just need to print energy level, player number does not matter here).
Input

First line will contain 2 integers n and d denoting the number of players in the game and number of days for which the game is played respectively.
Next line contains n integers denoting the initial energy levels of all the players.
Next d lines contain one of the 2 operations mentioned above.

Output
Print d lines with each integer(ith) denoting the Maximum energy level after the ith day.
Constraints

1 <= n,d <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 109
1 <= i, U, V <= n
1 <= X <= 109

Input:
5 5
10 6 1 10 3

You are at a party of NN people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be presentmay be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone at the party. Your task is to find the stranger(guest) at the party.   
You will be given a square matrix M where if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means the ith person knows the jth person. You need to find the 1≤id≤N of the guest if present, otherwise print −1.   
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of 2 lines.

The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of people at the party.   
Next N lines contain N2 integers of the matrix M, where each line contains N integers.

Output Format:
For each test case, print the id of the celebrity if present. Otherwise, print "-1".
Constraints:

1≤T≤50
2≤N≤3000
M[i][j] = 0 or 1
1≤id≤N

Explanation:
For 1st test case, given matrix M as:
0 1 0
0 0 0
0 1 0
The first row denotes the connection for 1st person and similarly for others. It is clear from the matrix that the 1st person knows only 2nd person. Also 3rd person knows only the 2nd person.
Here, the 2nd person is the guest because every other person knows him and he doesn't knows anyone. Therefore, 2 is printed on a new line.

Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a matrix of integers AA with NN rows (numbered 11 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). Each element of this matrix is either 0 or 1.
A move consists of the following steps:

Choose two different rows r1 and r2 or two different columns c1 and c2.
Apply the bitwise OR operation with the second row/column on the first row/column. Formally, if you chose two rows, this means you should change Ar1,k to Ar1,k∨Ar2,k for each 1≤k≤M; if you chose two columns, then you should change Ak,c1 to Ak,c1∨Ak,c2 for each 1≤k≤N.

For each element of the matrix, compute the minimum number of moves required to make it equal to 1 or determine that it is impossible. Note that these answers are independent, i.e. we are starting with the initial matrix for each of them.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains M integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,M NOT separated by spaces.

Output
For each test case, print N lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain M space-separated integers; for each valid j, the j-th of these integers should be the minimum number of moves required to make Ai,j equal to 1, or −1 if it is impossible.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N,M≤1,000
Ai,j∈{0,1} for each valid i,j
the sum of N⋅M for all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000

Chef has an array AA of length NN. He defines the alternating sum of the array as:

S=|A1|−|A2|+|A3|−|A4|+…(−1)N−1⋅|AN|S=|A1|−|A2|+|A3|−|A4|+…(−1)N−1⋅|AN|

Chef is allowed to perform the following operation on the array at most once:

Choose two indices i and j (1≤i<j≤N) and swap the elements Ai and Aj.

Find the maximum alternating sum Chef can achieve by performing the operation at most once.
Note: |X| denotes the absolute value of X. For example, |−4|=4 and |7|=7.
Input Format

The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains a single integer N - size of the array A.
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers - denoting the elements of array A.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line, the maximum alternating sum Chef can obtain by performing the operation at most once.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test Case 1: One optimal way is to perform no operations. Thus the alternating sum is |10|−|−10|=10−10=0.
Test Case 2: One optimal way is to choose i=2 and j=5. After swapping, the array is [−3,1,−1,0,−2,2,3]. The alternating sum in this case is |−3|−|1|+|−1|−|0|+|−2|−|2|+|3|=6.

Chef is participating in a pogo stick race. In this competition, there are N squares (numbered 1 through N) in a row. Chef must choose a starting square, enter this square and start jumping on his pogo stick. In each jump, if Chef is at a square s, then he can only jump to the square s+K. If square s+K does not exist, Chef jumps out of the row of squares and the race ends for him. It is not allowed to stop jumping any earlier.
Each square has a value; let's denote the value of the i-th square by Ai. Initially, Chef has 0 points. When he jumps in some square (including the initial square), he is awarded a number of points equal to the value of this square, exactly once. Note that if this value is negative, the number of Chef's points is decreased.
Determine the maximum possible total number of points Chef can get if he selects the initial cell optimally.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.

It's Christmas time, Santa's friends are helping him to arrange the gifts. Franklin is a new member of Santa's group and he too help the others in arranging the gifts. Let n be the number of gifts. Santa has a unique technique of ordering ,he put a number on each gift and then he  write the order of the gifts on a piece of paper and give it to his friends .But Franklin being a new member does not know about this technique so he arrange the gifts haphazardly without maintaining the order. But then one of the other member told him about this technique. Franklin finds himself in deep trouble and asks for your help.
You are given the order of the gifts that Santa has given on the paper and also the order by which Franklin arranges the gifts. You have to find the minimum number of swaps required to convert Franklin's order to Santa's. 
Input:
t:  No of test cases
n:  No of gifts
arr: elements written by Santa on the paper
brr: order by which Franklin arranges the gifts  
Output:
t lines containing the minimum no of swaps required to convert brr to arr.  
Constraints:
1<=t<=100
1<=n<=10^5
1<=arr[],brr[]<=10^4  
Sample Input:
2
4
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3
1 3 2
1 3 2   
Sample Output:
2
0  
Explanation:
1st test case-
If we swap 2 and 1 the array brr becomes [1,3,2,4][1,3,2,4] .Now  we have to swap 3 and 2 hence the array becomes [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4].This the number of swaps is 22.
2nd test case:
Both the arrays are equal. So number of swaps is 00.

There are NN hills, each having the elevation associated with it. You need to find out the hill range of length KK having the maximum beauty.
A range can be formed by deleting some of the hills from the array of elevations.
A hill range XX is more beautiful than another hill range Y (of the same length) if in the first hill where X and Y differ, X has a lower elevation than the Y.
The length of a range is the number of hills present in it.
Input:

First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
First Line of each test case will have two integers N,K. 
Second-line will have N integers representing the elevation of hills.

Output:

For each test case, output K integers representing the elevation of hills in the most beautiful range.

Read problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
Chef and Divyam are playing a game. They start with a rational number XX, such that 0<X<10<X<1.
In each turn, Chef chooses a positive real number YY. Then Divyam either adds or subtracts YY to XX. So XX is replaced with either X+YX+Y or X−YX−Y. If this number becomes 00 or 11, then Chef wins. Otherwise, the game continues.
You are given XX, and you have to determine whether Chef can win in a finite number of moves. More formally, does there exist a finite number NN so that Chef has a strategy that is guaranteed to win in at most NN moves?
Here, XX will be given in the form ABAB, where AA and BB are positive integers, A<BA<B and gcd(A,B)=1gcd(A,B)=1.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers AA and BB.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if Chef can win the game in a finite number of moves and "No" otherwise (without quotes). You can print "Yes" or "No" in any case.
Constraints

Yes
No


Explanation
Test case 1: Chef will choose Y=12Y=12, so whatever Divyam does, the number will become 00 or 11. Hence Chef will win in a finite number of moves. 
Test case 2: No matter what Chef chooses, it can be shown that Divyam can make sure Chef never wins.

Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an array of NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and three more integers X,p,X,p, and k.
An operation on the array is defined to be: replace the k-th smallest integer in the array with any integer you want.
Output the minimum number of operations you must perform on the array (possibly 0 operations) to make the p-th smallest  element of the array equal to X. If it is impossible to do so output −1.
Note: the k-th smallest number in an array is the k-th number from the left when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four integers N,X,p,k respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of operations you must perform to make X the p-th smallest element or −1 if its impossible to do so.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤p,k≤N
0≤X≤109
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 4∗105
0≤Ai≤109 for each valid i

                        Sample Output 1
                        





1
-1


Explanation
Example case 1:

We can perform one operation in the array. Take the k-th smallest integer of the current array (which is 8 in this case) and replace it with 0. The array then becomes [4,9,7,0,0] which now makes 4 as the 3rd smallest number of the array.

Example case 2:

It is impossible to make 25 as the smallest number of the array.

Riggi  is spying him since 5 years and he is not able to find  any evidence against Anit. 
KBI told Riggi they will send him a code string in a special format that will inform him whether he  has continue or return back from mission.
According to KBI  firstly  he  has to find what is the original string and then he has to check string is palindrome or not .
If its a palindrome then he has to leave the mission and return back else continue spying Anit. 
Rules to find original string :
1:-If in Code string any integer(N) followed by a string of alphabets that starts with '+' and  ends with '-' then he has to repeat that string N times  , like 3+acg- = acgacgacg.
2:-If there is no integer present before string then print the string is repeated 1 time.
    like bc=bc.
Example of conversion from  Code string  to original string  : 2+ac-3+kb-j=acackbkbkbj  
Input:

Code string S is taken as input  .

On a random day, Ayushi came running to her hostel to UN-box her parcel, that she received from an e-commerce website as a gift from an unknown guy. To her surprise, the parcel had a secured case, which prompted her to play a small game to break into the security.
The game was simple.
Ayushi was asked to enter a number N and she had to find the largest number having N digit which is the "Samosa Number".
"Samosa number" is developed by a "Samosa" Lover, that unknown boy.
A number P is a Samosa Number if it follows the following three criteria :
1.The number should consist of the odd digit at the odd positions but starts with an even digit.
2.The number consists of each digit from 1 to N at most once.
3.The number is prime.
Ayushi was not so genius neither a coder, so she came running to you for the code. Are you willing to solve the problem for her, provided she is extremely cute and single, searching for a coder friend.
INPUT
A single integer (1≤N≤8). The number consists of integers from 1 to N but doesn't consist of 0.
OUTPUT
The largest number of N digit that is a Samosa Number.
If it doesn't exist, then output "Dont Exist for N"(Value of N) without the quotes.

Sample Input
2

Sample Output
Dont Exist for 2

Sample Input
4

Sample Output

Explanation
Example 1. The entire mountain range is already a temple. So, there is no need to make any operation.
Example 2. If you reduce the height of the first block to 0. You get 0 1 2 1. The blocks 1, 2, 1 form a temple. So, the answer is 1.
Example 3. One possible temple can be 1 2 3 2 1. It requires 3 operations to build. This is the minimum amount you have to spend in order to build a temple.

Assume you're the owner of "XMAS" Factory located in Udyambag, Belagavi. This XMAS Factory is well known for producing high-quality toy cars including Christmas gifts for kids. These toy cars when turned ON moves forward and autonomously navigates. 
There are MM different types of toy cars. Each type of toy car has NN number cars. There are MM number of machines which produce cars of its corresponding type. For example a "Type 1" machine would produce "Type 1" car only. There is only one machine for each type. Each machine has a special button that reverses the logic of the circuit used in the toy car.  For example, if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move forward when turned ON then by pressing this special button on this machine, the car produced would move backward instead of moving forward similarly, if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move backward when turned ON then by pressing this special button on this machine, the car produced would move forward instead of moving backward thus revering the logic. K is the number of machines in which this special button is turned ON.

A car is said to have correct logic if and only if it moves forward when turned ON.
A car is said to have incorrect logic if it moves backward when turned ON.

The factory has produced M*N number of toy cars. Out of which there are some faulty cars produced with incorrect logic. In order to correct the logic, all the cars are put back into corresponding types of machine. If K is the number of machines in which the special button is turned ON (pressed), you being the owner want to know what maximum number of cars could be produced with correct logic.
Input:

First line will contain single integer T indicating the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains 3 integers namely M, N and K where M is the total number of types of toy cars,  N is the total number of toy cars produced in each type, and K is the exact number of special buttons that will be turned ON.
For each of the next M lines, there is a single integer between 0 and N that indicates the number of cars that are with correct logic.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer indicating the maximum number of toy cars with correct logic.
Constraints

1≤T≤20
1≤K≤M≤106
1≤N≤106

Sample Input 1:
    2

Sample Output 1:
    4
    5

EXPLANATION:
There are two test cases in this sample test file.
In the first test case, there are two types of cars with each type having in total 2 number of cars. Since there are two types of cars there would be corresponding two types of machines producing it. In the first type say "Type 1", both the cars have correct logic and in the second type say "Type 2", both the cars have incorrect logic. Since K=1, the special button of the "Type 2" machine can be turned ON to correct the logic of both the "Type 2" cars. Hence all the cars can be implemented with correct logic.
In the second test case, there are two types of cars with each type having in total 4 number of cars. Since there are two types of cars there would be corresponding two types of machines producing it. In the first type say "Type 1"  all the cars have incorrect logic and in the second type say "Type 2", 1 car has incorrect logic and remaining 3 cars have correct logic. Since K = 2, the special button on both the machines must be turned ON. As a result, the number of cars with correct logic implemented are 4 from "Type 1" and 1 from "Type 2"

Jumping Jack is new to the Heroic Society.He is so obsessed with jumping that he can do it the whole day without getting tired
Jumping Jack likes challenges a lot, and he is challenged by the beautiful Cho Chang to jump a river.
Since Jumping Jack can't jump the river in a single leap, Cho Chang gave him N magical leaves which will float on water.
Jumping Jack arranged the leaves in a stright line on the water's surface.
The last leaf arraged by Jumping Jack represents the bank of the river. If Jumping Jack can reach the last leaf then it means that 
  can cross the river.

Jumping jack has three different style of jumping which are as follows:

Jump one step forward
Jump two steps forward 
Jump three steps forward 

But there's a twist in the game.Cho Chang unknowingly gave him some pseudo-magical leaves.
If Jumping Jack steps on any pseudo-magical leaf he will drown.
You are given the information about the leaves arranged by Jumping Jack in the form of an array A.
A[i] is Zero if the leaf is magical and One if it is pseudo-magical
Find out whether it is possible for Jumping Jack to cross the river or not,
if YES then the minimum leaps required by him to cross the river.
if NOthen print "Never Give Up" without quotes.
Note: Reaching the last leaf is considered as crossing the river. If Jumping Jack can't reach the last leaf then he can't cross the river
Initially Jumping Jack is standing on the first leaf.

 
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
   The description of T test cases follows.
   First line of each test case contains an integer N
   Second line contains N space separated integers denoting whether the leaf is magical(0) or pseudo-magical(1)
 
Output
For each test case output one single line the minimum number of leaps required to cross the river if it is possible.
  If it is not possible to cross the river then print "Never Give Up" without quotes

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese,Russian and Vietnamese as well.
The snakes want to build a temple for Lord Cobra. There are multiple strips of land that they are looking at, but not all of them are suitable. They need the strip of land to resemble a coiled Cobra. You need to find out which strips do so.
Formally, every strip of land, has a length. Suppose the length of the i-th strip is is Ni, then there will be Ni integers, Hi1, Hi2, .. HiNi, which represent the heights of the ground at various parts of the strip, in sequential order. That is, the strip has been divided into Ni parts and the height of each part is given. This strip is valid, if and only if all these conditions are satisfied:

There should be an unique 'centre' part. This is where the actual temple will be built. By centre, we mean that there should be an equal number of parts to the left of this part, and to the right of this part.
Hi1 = 1
The heights keep increasing by exactly 1, as you move from the leftmost part, to the centre part.
The heights should keep decreasing by exactly 1, as you move from the centre part to the rightmost part. Note that this means that HiNi should also be 1.

Your job is to look at every strip and find if it's valid or not.
Input

The first line contains a single integer, S, which is the number of strips you need to look at. The description of each of the S strips follows
The first line of the i-th strip's description will contain a single integer: Ni, which is the length and number of parts into which it has been divided.
The next line contains Ni integers: Hi1, Hi2, .., HiNi. These represent the heights of the various parts in the i-th strip.

Output

For each strip, in a new line, output "yes" if is a valid strip, and "no", if it isn't.

Constraints

1 ≤ S ≤ 100 
3 ≤ Ni ≤ 100 
1 ≤ Hij ≤ 100

Input:

1 2 2 1

Output:
yes
no
no
no
yes
no
no

Explanation
In the first strip, all the conditions are satisfied, hence it is valid.
In the second strip, it does not start with a 1, and hence is invalid.
In the third strip, it keeps increasing even past the centre, instead of decreasing. Hence invalid.
The fourth strip does not increase and decrease by exactly 1. Hence invalid.
The fifth satisfies all conditions and hence is valid.
The sixth and seventh strip do not have a 'centre' part. Because for every part, there are either more parts to its right than its left, or more parts on its left than its right. Hence both the strips are invalid.

In the cursed land of earth where all crops are failing, Tom Cooper is trying to grow n acres of crop this season, and he can grow one crop in an acre. Tom has two sets of n crop seeds each. In the two sets, the two ith crop seeds are the same type crop.
The first set of n crop seeds are independent and each of them require their own preparation and can be grown independently. The ith crop under this category will take a cost of xi.
The second set of n crops are genetically modified to withstand extreme conditions and even withstand the intense dust storms. But there is one thing: to allot a proper usage of resources, the crops are designed in such a way that the ith crop can be directly grown without fertiliser or other resource if the genetically modified (i−1)th crop is grown: that is, for example, the waste material of the (i−1)th crop can be fertiliser for the ith crop, etc. Thus he can grow the ith crop in them in a constant c cost along with a preparation cost of cki but if he has also grown the (i−1)th genetically modified crop, he can skip the preparation cost and grow the ith crop in just c cost.
Since the world market expects a lot of variety in the crops available, Tom wants to maximize the number of different types of crops he grows. That is for example, Tom can grow only genetically modified crop 1 on all his fields. In that case, he grows 1 crop. Tom wants to maximize this number of crops he grows. Note that growing both genetically modified and normal versions of the same crop count as growing 1 crop only, and not 2.
Thus, Tom wants you to find out the maximum number of different crops he can grow, and the corresponding minimum cost at which he can grow n sets of crops.
Input format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains two numbers n and c.
The second line has n integers x1,x2,…,xn.
The third line has n integers k1,k2,…,kn.

Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤n≤104
1≤c≤109
1≤x[i]≤109
1≤k[i]≤10

Output format
For each test case, output a line having two integers - the maximum number of different crops that can be grown, and the minimum cost that'll be taken for this set of crops.

Sheldon loves trains. One day he decided to take a trip. He has a map of the train routes. He wants to find the total travel duration between any two given stations. A train traveling from station a to b will stop at all intermediate stations for a particular amount of time.  The map has the following information:

 The travel times between two consecutive stations.
 The waiting times for all intermediate stations.
 He wants to find the total travel duration between any two stations subject to the following 2 conditions:

 Considering the waiting times of all intermediate stations without any changes (Condition - a)
 Considering the waiting times of all intermediate stations to be the smallest of all waiting times of stations between the starting station and the ending station (Condition - b)



See Explanation Section for better understanding.
Input

First line has an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

First line of each test case has N, the number of stations.
Second line of each test case has timei, the time for traveling from stationi to stationi+1.
Third line of each test case has waiti, the waiting times for the intermediate stations between the first and last stations
Fourth line has Q, the number of queries, Q lines follow
Each query has K , A and B - the type of query, the starting and ending stations,respectively.

 
Output

For each query, print one line.
If query type is 0, the line should contain the total duration by applying condition-a.
If query type is 1, the line should contain the total duration by applying condition-b.

 The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
 The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
 The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.


Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:



Round
Player 1
Player 2


1
140
82


2
89
134


3
90
110


4
112
106


5
88
90



The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:


Round
Player 1
Player 2
Leader
Lead


1
140
82
Player 1
58


2
229
216
Player 1
13


3
319
326
Player 2
7


4
431
432
Player 2
1


5
519
522
Player 2
3


Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
 The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
 Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
 The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
≤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 ≤ Si ≤
1000 and 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000.  
Output
 Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

Little kids, Jack and Evan like playing their favorite game Glass-and-Stone. Today they want to play something new and came across Twitter on their father's laptop.

They saw it for the first time but were already getting bored to see a bunch of sentences having at most 140 characters each. The only thing they liked to play with it is, closing and opening tweets.

There are N tweets on the page and each tweet can be opened by clicking on it, to see some statistics related to that tweet. Initially all the tweets are closed. Clicking on an open tweet closes it and clicking on a closed tweet opens it. There is also a button to close all the open tweets. Given a sequence of K clicks by Jack, Evan has to guess the total number of open tweets just after each click. Please help Evan in this game.

Input
First line contains two integers N K, the number of tweets (numbered 1 to N) and the number of clicks respectively (1 ≤ N, K ≤ 1000). Each of the following K lines has one of the following.CLICK X , where X is the tweet number (1 ≤ X ≤ N)
CLOSEALL
Output
Output K lines, where the ith line should contain the number of open tweets just after the ith click.

Explanation
Let open[x] = 1 if the xth tweet is open and 0 if its closed.
Initially open[1..3] = { 0 , 0 , 0 }. Here is the state of open[1..3] after each click and corresponding count of open tweets.
CLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1
CLICK 2 : { 1, 1, 0 }, open count = 2
CLICK 3 : { 1, 1, 1 }, open count = 3
CLICK 2 : { 1, 0, 1 }, open count = 2
CLOSEALL : { 0, 0, 0 }, open count = 0
CLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1

You are participating in a contest which has 1111 problems (numbered 11 through 1111). The first eight problems (i.e. problems 1,2,…,81,2,…,8) are scorable, while the last three problems (9, 10 and 11) are non-scorable ― this means that any submissions you make on any of these problems do not affect your total score.
Your total score is the sum of your best scores for all scorable problems. That is, for each scorable problem, you look at the scores of all submissions you made on that problem and take the maximum of these scores (or 0 if you didn't make any submissions on that problem); the total score is the sum of the maximum scores you took.
You know the results of all submissions you made. Calculate your total score.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of submissions you made.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers pi and si, denoting that your i-th submission was on problem pi and it received a score si.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― your total score.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤1,000
1≤pi≤11 for each valid i
0≤si≤100 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (15 points): all submissions are on the same problem, i.e. p1=p2=…=pN
Subtask #2 (15 points): there is at most one submission made on each problem, i.e. pi≠pj for each valid i,j (i≠j)
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The scorable problems with at least one submission are problems 2 and 8. For problem 2, there are two submissions and the maximum score among them is 45. For problem 8, there are also two submissions and the maximum score is 90. Hence, the total score is 45+90=135.
Example case 2: No scorable problem is attempted, so the total score is 0.

You are given an array AA with length NN. On each day, the following process was performed:

a new array R is created; this array contains all elements Ai such that i=1, i=N or min(Ai−1,Ai+1)≤Ai (2≤i<N), in the original order
A is replaced by R and N is replaced by the length of R

In other words, all elements of A that are between two bigger elements disappear.
For each element of the original array, calculate the number of the day on which it disappeared (the process starts with day 1), or determine that it never disappeared.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the number of the day on which the i-th element of the original array disappeared, or 0 if it never disappeared.

You are given an array A with size N and a number K. Let's call a position i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) valid if, after increasing Ai by K, it would be greater than the sum of all other elements in the array A.

Determine the number of distinct valid positions.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid positions.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100,000
1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000
1 ≤ K ≤ 109
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 104 for each valid i
1 ≤ sum of N over all test cases ≤ 100,000

Explanation

Example case 1: A1 + K = 6 isn't greater than A2 + A3 + A4 = 14, so position 1 isn't valid. A2 + K = 5 isn't greater than A1 + A3 + A4 = 15, so position 2 isn't valid. A3 + K = 10 isn't greater than A1 + A2 + A4 = 10, so position 3 also isn't valid. A4 + K = 11 is greater than A1 + A2 + A3 = 9. Therefore, there is only one valid position — position 4.

JJ challenges his friend GG to construct an array A containing N distinct elements such that the following conditions hold:

For all 1≤i≤N, 1≤Ai≤105
For every subarray of length ≥2, the sum of all the elements of the subarray is not divisible by the length of the subarray

Please help perplexed GG to complete JJ's challenge.
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A to be constructed.

Output Format
For each test case, output an array A containing N distinct elements which satisfy the given conditions.
If there are multiple arrays that satisfy the conditions, print any.
Constraints

Explanation
Test case-1: Following are the subarrays of length ≥2:

Length=2: sum([7,2])=9, sum([2,5])=7
Length=3: sum([7,2,5])=14 

We can see that for each of these subarrays, the sum is not divisible by the length.
Test case-2: Following are the subarrays of length ≥2:

Length=2: sum([3,18])=21, sum([18,11])=29, sum([11,2])=13 
Length=3: sum([3,18,11])=32, sum([18,11,2])=31
Length=4: sum([3,18,11,2])=34

We can see that for each of these subarrays, the sum is not divisible by the length.

Finally the LazyProblemSetters have decided the way in which they will attempt the questions in the problem set. They have decided to go to the Computer Lab of the CSE department (because it has air-conditioning) and are ready to get their hands dirty with some WA's and TLE's.

Their department has a very unique lab. They have a lot of computers and each student gets a private account which they can access through any of those computers. For this, no data is stored on these computers but on dedicated servers and sent to the computer that a student is currently using. This way the students are not forced to sit on particular computers and can choose any place they like that is available.

Now, the department has a home built advanced facial recognition software which they use in this lab. It works as follows:When anyone sits on a computer, his/her picture is captured, (along with the locality) and sent to the internal database of the lab where they identify the user associated with that picture, and the computer he/she is sitting. After that the data of that user is fetched from the dedicated data servers and sent to the computer.

Now, all this takes time, and to keep the user busy, they decided to give them a puzzle to solve. If the user solves the puzzle correctly, they are allowed to login. The puzzle is as follows:


 A string S (composed of only small case letters of the English alphabet) is shown on the screen to the user.
 Then two integers P and Q are shown to the users. 
 The user has now to create a string R using S and P by concatenating P copies of S one after another.
Then R is transformed into its smallest lexicographic permutation i.e. all the "a"'s are brought to the front and placed there, then after that all the "b"'s are placed, then "c"'s and so on. This is the final R that the user needs to form.
 Then Q numbers appear on the screen one by one. For each number N that appears on the screen, the user has to type the character at the Nth location of R. If N is greater than the length of R, they have to type "-1" (without quotes).


Input
The first line consists of an integer T, the number of test cases followed by the test cases themselves. 
Each test case begins with the string S in the first line, followed by two space-separated integers P and Q in the next line. 
Then Q lines follow, each containing an integer N.

Output
For each test case, for each integer N, print in a new line the character at the Nth location of R  or print "-1" (without quotes) as described above. 
Constraints

 1 ≤ P ≤ 107 
 1 ≤ N ≤ 109 
 1 ≤ Q ≤ 105 
 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100, where |S| denotes the length of the string. 
 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 

Example
Input:
1
abcde
3 5
3
4
10
15
16

Output:
a
b
d
e
-1

Ants have developed advanced ways to find, distribute and make their own food, to such extent that, it has been said that ants eat more meat than lions wolves and tigers combined!
Argentine ant is one of the world’s worst invasive species(Species which are not native to a specific location, but have tendency to spread to a degree to cause damage to the native 
species of a region) present in the Norfolk Island. It forms supercolonies and are aggressive competitors, displacing most other ant species. It can alter ecosystem processes such as 
pollination and seed dispersal of native plant species.
The federal environment department is in its mission to wipe out the species from  Norfolk Island. So, they are carrying out a survey in T sites within the island examinig the 
food sources. They know that the ant species can survive in a site only if the food available is more than K units or else they will eventually die out from the site. For every site, 
they go around the region examining N food sources, and finding A[i], the unit of food available from the ith source(1 ≤ i ≤ N).

Determine for each site, whether the ant species can survive or they die out from the specific site.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers T and K. Then, information of T sites of the island follow.
For each T, the first line contains N, the number of food sources and the second line contains N space-separated integers, A[i] (1 ≤ i 
≤ N).


Output
For each T, output "SUCCESS" without quotes, if the ant species die out or "FAILURE" if the ant species survives.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ K ≤ 1018
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1013


Example Input
3 7
2
4 4
5
1 8 6 4 5

Example Output
FAILURE
FAILURE
SUCCESS



Example case 1:In the region the total food available is 8 units. So the ants survive.

Chef has a large integer and for storing it he has used an integer array named digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Chef wants to increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the length of the array.
The next line contains N space-separated integers D1,D2,…,DN, denoting the given array.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers of the resulting array.
Constraints

1 <= digits.length <= 100
0 <= digits[i] <= 9
digits does not contain any leading 0's.

Explanation
first array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
second array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
third array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an array A, consisting of N integers and an array B, consisting of M integers.
The subsequence of A is the array that can be obtained by picking the elements at the arbitrary sorted set of positions from A.
Your task is to count the number of such subsequences C of A that:

C contains exactly M elements.
The array (C+B) is non-decreasing. Here by + operation, we mean element-wise sum. 
For example, the array (4, 8, 5) plus the array (10, 20, 30) is (14, 28, 35).
Formally, (C+B) is an array of size M such that (C+B)i = Ci + Bi.


In case some subsequence appears more that once, you should counts it as many times as it appears.
Formally, two subarrays of an array a, (ai_1, ai_2, ... ,ai_n) and (aj_1, aj_2, ... ,aj_m) will be considered different if either their lengths are different i.e. n != m or there exists an index k such that such that i_k  != j_k.

Since the answer can be very large, we ask you to calculate it, modulo 109+7.
Input
The first line of input contains a pair of space separated integers N and M, denoting the number of elements in the array A and the number of elements in the array B.
The second line contains N space-separated integers Ai, denoting the array A.
The third line contains M space-separated integers Bj, denoting the array B.
Output
Output a single line containing the number of subsequences C as asked in the problem, modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 109
1 ≤ M ≤ N

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (33 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, 1 ≤ M ≤ 5
Subtask #2 (33 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 500, 1 ≤ M ≤ 50
Subtask #3 (34 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000

Example
Input #1:
5 3
1 5 2 4 7
7 9 6

Output #1:
4

Input #2:
4 2
7 7 7 7
3 4

Output #2:
6

Explanation
Example case 1. The suitable subsequences are (1, 2, 7), (1, 4, 7), (5, 4, 7), (2, 4, 7).
Example case 2. The suitable subsequence is (7, 7), and it appears 6 times:

at indices (1, 2)
at indices (1, 3)
at indices (1, 4)
at indices (2, 3)
at indices (2, 4)
at indices (3, 4)


So, the answer is 6.

Given an array AA consisting of NN non-negative integers. 
You need to perform the following operation (N−1)(N−1) times:

Sort the array A in ascending order.
Let M be the current size of the array A. Replace the array A by [(A2−A1),(A3−A2),…,(AM−AM−1)]. Note that each time the operation is performed, the size of the array reduces by one.

Find the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, output single line: the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤1018
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

1
777


Explanation

Test case 1: The operations look like:
Operation 1: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [0,3,19,29]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(3−0),(19−3),(29−19)]=[3,16,10].
Operation 2: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [3,10,16]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(10−3),(16−10)]=[7,6].
Operation 3: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [6,7]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(7−6)]=[1].

Thus, the remaining element after 3 operations is 1.

Test case 2: Since N=1, you don't need to perform any operation. The remaining element after 0 operations is 777.

Example case 1: We can take k for Ak to be either 1 or 2, since Ak=2 either way. Since the problem asks for unordered pairs, (1,2) is the only possible valid pair (the same as (2,1)). Hence, the answer is 1.
Example case 2: We see that A1=2=(1+3)/2. No other valid pair exists.

The range of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value in it.
Chef comes up with a crazy idea to minimize the range by changing atmost 33 elements in the array. He wants to check whether the minimum range he gets is right or not.
Please help him in verifying his answer.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each test case contains an integer NN, the no. of integers in the array.
Second line contains N space separated integers, A0,A1,...,An−1. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the minimum range.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
3≤N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109

Sample Input:
1
6
3 5 0 2 10 0

Sample Output:
2

EXPLANATION:
Chef changes the elements 3, 5 and 10 to 0, 1 and 2, resulting in the array: [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0].
The minimum range is 2−0=2. There can be multiple ways to change atmost 3 elements to get the answer.

Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
In Chefland, types of ingredients are represented by integers and recipes are represented by sequences of ingredients that are used when cooking. One day, Chef found a recipe represented by a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN at his front door and he is wondering if this recipe was prepared by him.
Chef is a very picky person. He uses one ingredient jar for each type of ingredient and when he stops using a jar, he does not want to use it again later while preparing the same recipe, so ingredients of each type (which is used in his recipe) always appear as a contiguous subsequence. Chef is innovative, too, so he makes sure that in each of his recipes, the quantity of each ingredient (i.e. the number of occurrences of this type of ingredient) is unique ― distinct from the quantities of all other ingredients.
Determine whether Chef could have prepared the given recipe.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the recipe could have been prepared by Chef or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤103
1≤Ai≤103 for each valid i

                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES
NO
NO


Explanation
Example case 1: For each ingredient type, its ingredient jar is used only once and the quantities of all ingredients are pairwise distinct. Hence, this recipe could have been prepared by Chef. 
Example case 2: The jar of ingredient 4 is used twice in the recipe, so it was not prepared by Chef.

Agent Chef 
RAW (Indian spy agency) hacked into a terrorist computer which according to 
their intelligence contains information about future terrorist attacks. But there is
a problem that the computer uses a particular encryption technique to safeguard its 
data. That computer gives a token, which consists of space separated elements. These 
elements are numbers each ranging from 0 to 9. It is known this encryption can be broken 
by constructing a number with the given elements in the order given by the computer and
adding the reverse of that number to the original number. The sum so obtained is the key
to break the encryption. This mission to construct the decryption device has been given to
agent Chef. Help the Chef construct this device. 
Input Format: 
First line contains an integer T, representing no. of test cases.
For each of test cases:
First line contains an integer N, representing size of token.
Second line contains N elements of token that are space separated.

Output Format: 
For each test case output will be a token of space separated elements.
Constraints: 
T <= 20
1 <= N <= 1000 
Each element will be a number from 0 to 9
Examples: 
Input
2
6
2 1 4 2 6 7
5
1 3 2 8 0
Output
9 7 6 6 7 9
2 1 5 1 1
Explanation:
First line gives T=2 (2 test cases). 6 in next line means there will be 6 elements in the 
token and the next line has the token itself. Output is 9 7 6 6 7 9 as 214267+762412=976679.
 Similarly, 13280+08231=21511 for the second test case.

Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
There are NN workers; each worker is of one of the following three types:

A translator translates some text from Chef's language to another langague.
An author writes some text in Chef's language.
An author-translator can both write a text in Chef's language and translate it to another language.

Chef wants to have some text written and translated into some language (different from Chef's language). Chef can't do either of those tasks, but he can hire workers. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), if he hires the ii-th worker, he must pay that worker cici coins.
Help Chef find the minimum total number of coins he needs to pay to have a text written and translated. It is guaranteed that it is possible to write and translate a text.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN denoting the number of workers.
The second line contins NN space-separated integers c1,c2,...,cNc1,c2,...,cN denoting the numbers of coins Chef has to pay each hired worker.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers t1,t2,...,tNt1,t2,...,tN denoting the types of workers. For each valid ii, the ii-th worker is a translator if ti=1ti=1, an author if ti=2ti=2 or an author-translator if ti=3ti=3.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of coins Chef has to pay.

One day Chef and his friend Alice decide to build a device which will transfer the data between them. The data is transferred in binary form i.e. 1 & 0. 
When the device was built they tried to test it. While testing the device they found out that due to noise in the data transferring channel they didn’t receive the 
data in exactly the same form, some of the digits of the data were misplaced or missing. So Chef and Alice decided that chef will fine tune the device and send the 
same data to Alice for N number of times and the data with lowest error will be accepted.

Your task is to help Alice find the ith sent data for which the minimum error is received.

Given that %error = (total no of wrong digits / total number of digits) × 100

Input

The first line of input contains two integer N denoting the numbers of times the data was sent and L denoting the length of the data sent. 
The second line contains the correct data which is to be transferred.
Each of the following  N  lines contain the data sent by the device in the ith attempt.


Output
Output a single line containing the string which has the lowest error.
Note:If there are more than one possible output with the same minimum error then output the first string which has the minimum error.


Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 103
1 ≤ L ≤ 103


Example Input:
2 5
11111
10101
11110


Example Output:

One day Chef's friend gave him a sequence a1,a2,a3,a4.....an. He told Chef to find the length of the longest appearing 
Even Sequence. An even sequence is a sequence formed with only consecutive even numbers(e.g. 4 8 2 14 is an even sequence but 4 8 5 14 is not). But the twist is that firstly 
he wants Chef to convert the sequence in a specified form where b1>= b2<=b3 >=b4<=.......... upto n terms and then find the length 
of the longest appearing Even Sequence.
NOTE: If there are multiple sequence possible, take the one that's lexicographically smallest.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer N denoting the numbers of Test Cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of element in the Sequence. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the sequence.


Output
output a single line containing the length of the longest appearing Even Sequence.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105


Example Input
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
6 7 8 10 12 16


Example Output
1
5


Explanation
Example case 1:The given sequence can be converted to 2 1 4 3 5, 5 2 3 1 4 etc.. but we'll take the lexicographically smallest one i.e. 2 1 4 3 5.  
Now we can see the longest appearing Even Sequence in the new sequence is 1.
Example case 2:Similarly as case 1 the lexicographically smallest sequence is 7 6 10 8 16 12 and the lenght of the longest appearing Even sequence is 5.

Chef recently graduated Computer Science in university, so he was looking for a job. He applied for several job offers, but he eventually settled for a software engineering job at ShareChat. Chef was very enthusiastic about his new job and the first mission assigned to him was to implement a message encoding feature to ensure the chat is private and secure.


Chef has a message, which is a string S with length N containing only lowercase English letters. It should be encoded in two steps as follows:

Swap the first and second character of the string S, then swap the 3rd and 4th character, then the 5th and 6th character and so on. If the length of S is odd, the last character should not be swapped with any other.

Replace each occurrence of the letter 'a' in the message obtained after the first step by the letter 'z', each occurrence of 'b' by 'y', each occurrence of 'c' by 'x', etc, and each occurrence of 'z' in the message obtained after the first step by 'a'.



The string produced in the second step is the encoded message. Help Chef and find this message.


Input:


The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.


The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.

The second line contains the message string S.



Output:

For each test case, print a single line containing one string — the encoded message.


Constraints:
1≤T≤1,000

1≤N≤100

|S|=N

S contains only lowercase English letters


Sample Input:

2

9

sharechat

4

chef

Sample Output:
shizxvzsg

sxuv

EXPLANATION:
Example case 1: The original message is "sharechat". In the first step, we swap four pairs of letters (note that the last letter is not swapped), so it becomes "hsraceaht". In the second step, we replace the first letter ('h') by 's', the second letter ('s') by 'h', and so on, so the resulting encoded message is "shizxvzsg".

Chef has recently acquired a job as a professor, but is rather disappointed in his students after evaluating their scores on a test. Chef has N students, and he has a list of marks of all the students, where the ith student has scored Ai marks. The minimum marks required to pass the test is M. If the topper scores less than M, Chef has decided to quit his job. Can you help Chef find out the score of the topper of the test?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains the number of Chef's students N and the minimum pass marks M.

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the scores of the students.


Output
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer which is the maximum score in the test if that score is not less than M. If it is less then M, print "RESIGN" (without quotes).

Saurabh loves to climb mountains, but he climbs the mountain only when the height of the mountains are in increasing order. Now he decided to climb the mountains, but it may be possible that the height of the mountains is not in increasing order.
There are NN mountains, whose heights are H[1],H[2],H[3],...,H[N]H[1],H[2],H[3],...,H[N]. But before climbing the mountains he has to arrange the height of mountains in increasing order.
For doing this he can swap the heights of any two adjacent mountains i.e. H[i]H[i] and H[i+1].
In swapping, the height of H[i] decreases by 1 while the height of H[i+1] increases by 1. This operation can be applied any number of times he wants. Can you help him to find the final sorted order of mountains so that he can climb the mountains?
Input:

The First-line contains an integer N, denoting the number of mountains.
The Second line contains N space-separated integers representing the height of mountains.

Output:
If it is possible to arrange the height of mountains in increasing order, then Print “YES” and Print the sorted height of mountains in the next line. Else Print “NO”.
Constraints

1<=N<=105
1<=H[i]<=105

Sample Input:
5
7 3 9 6 10

Sample Output:
YES
4 6 7 8 10

EXPLANATION:
In the given example [7,3,9,6,10],
he will swap 7 and 3 changing the value of 7 to 6 and 3 to 4, now the heights are [4, 6, 9, 6, 10] and 
Again, he will swap 9 and 6 changing the value of 9 to 8 and 6 to 7, now the heights are [4, 6, 7, 8, 10]. The heights are in Increasing Order.

There are n piles of coins, where the ith pile has ai coins. You need to collect the maximum number of coins from these piles, but you must fulfill the following condition: 
Let's say you pick xi coins from the ith pile, then:

x1+x3+x5… = x2+x4+x6
0≤xi≤ai

For example, if n=3 and, a=[2,3,2], you can pick the coins as x= [1,2,1] becuase x1+x3=1+1=2 and x2=2
Find the maximum total number of coins you can pick.
Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer n denoting the number of piles.
The second line of input contains n space-separated integers ai, where the ith integer denoted the number of coins in ith pile.

Output:
Print a single integer denoting the maximum total number of coins you can pick.
Constraints

2≤n≤105
1≤ai≤103

Sample Input:
4
5 1 1 4

Sample Output:
10

Explanation:
Let x=[4,1,1,4] hence x1+x3=x2+x4 and total number of coins picked is 10. It can be checked that it is not possible to pick any greater number of coins.

Arya's birthday is here and he has received many gifts. He has received a total of N gifts from his N friends. Each of these friends has gifted him with K numbers.


Now, for each of these gifts he received, Arya has calculated the XOR of all the numbers in the i-th gift.

Furthermore, he found the bitwise AND, S of all these XOR values.
Since he hates being the center of attention in a party, he has decided to minimize the value of S. However, so as not to seem rude, he can only toggle at most one bit at any position of a number in any gift that he recieved.

Since, Arya is busy managing his guests, he needs your help to find the minimum value of S.

 
Input
The first lint contains T,the number of test cases.
The first line of each test cases contains two space separated integers, N and K.
The subsequent N lines contain K space separated integers G[i] denoting each number gifted by that friend.


 
Output
Print T lines, where each line contains the answer to the corresponding test case.

Constraints
1 ≤ T≤ 1000 
1 ≤ N,K≤ 1000 
1 ≤ G[i]≤ (2^10)-1
 
Example
Input:

1
2 2
1 2
3 4


Output:

1

 
Explanation
Example case 1.

XOR of all values in the first row: 3

XOR of all values in the second row: 7


On toggling the 2nd (from the right) bit of the first gift of the first friend, the minimum answer is received.


XOR of all values in the first row: 1

XOR of all values in the second row: 7


1 AND 7 = 1.

Problem description.
Sachin always loves to play with very large number. He spends most of his time in dealing with very large numbers. One day, he 
and his friend Harry went to hill station. Even at the hill station, Sachin counts different staffs and power them with some
fixed number. Harry got irritated with his behavior. So he gave him a set of two numbers (a and b) and told him to find 
out the number a^b where ^ represents exponentiation operator but since they are at hill station so they don't have any paper
so he just asked him to write the number in his palm after ignoring the first n-1 digits where n is number of digits in a^b 
where a and b are very large number.

Input
First line contains an integer T (the number of testcases).
Then the only line of each test case contains two space separated a and b.

Output
For each case print in a new line the required number.
Constraints
T<=1000
0<=a<=10^501
0<=b<=10^16

 
Example
Input:
2
2 2
3 2
Output:
4
9

 
Explanation
1st test case, 2^2 is 4 since it is single digit so output is 4.

Shini has n toys on the shelf of her room. Each of her Toys have a name. When she tried to arrange them in 
alphabetical order, she realized that the names of all her toys start with either K,M or L. If Shini arranges
 all her toys in a random order (not in the alphabetical order) then find the least number of her toys that
 can be taken off the shelf so that no two adjacent toys have names starting with the same letter.

 
Input
The first lint contains T,the number of test cases.
The first line of each test cases contains integer n — the number of toys on the shelf.
The next line contains string s, which represents the first letter of each toy in order. We'll consider
 the toys in the row numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Then the i-th character s equals "K", if th
 e i-th toy's name starts with K, "L", if it starts with L and "M", if it starts with M. 

 
Output
For each test cases print a single integer — the answer to the problem 
Constraints
1 ≤ T≤ 1000 
1 ≤ N≤ 100000 
 
Example
Input:

A Pastry chef made N pieces of pastries, numbered them 1 through N and arranged them in this order in a row. There are K possible types of flavours (numbered 1 through K); for each valid i, the i-th piece of pastry has a flavour Ai.
The Chef wants to select a contiguous subsegment of the pieces of pastry such that there is at least one flavour which does not occur in that subsegment. Find the maximum possible length of such a subsegment of cakes.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum length of a valid subsegment.

Constraints
1≤T≤1,000 
1≤N≤105
2≤K≤105
1≤Ai≤K for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Our Chef is hosting a cooking competition in which only two teams can compete at the same time. Both sides should have an equal number of participants to make the competition engaging and fair. Chef was given the duty of forming the two teams as an organizer.
There are various conditions for forming teams. He will be assigned a number 'N' for each competition, and for each divisor 'D' of 'N' (including 1 and 'N' itself), he will add a member:
1) If 'D' is even, go to the first team.
2) if 'D' is odd, go to the second team.
Chef needs your assistance with the event planning because he is quite busy. Your job is to advise the chef whether or not he can make two teams with the same amount of members.
For Example:
For ‘N’ = 10,
The divisors are:
1, 2, 5, 10.
The first team will have two members corresponding to even divisors 2 and 10.
The second team will have two members corresponding to odd divisors 1 and 5.
So, in this case, Chef can make two teams.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the number given to Chef.

Output Format
For each test case print 1 if Chef can make two teams of equal members with the given ‘N’, else print 0.
Output for each test case will be printed in a separate line.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases doesn’t exceed 10^5.

Explanation
In test case 1:
N = 7, the divisors of 7 are 1,7.
The first team will have 0 members since there are no even divisors.
The second team will have 2 members corresponding to divisors 1 and 7.
Since the teams have a different number of members, the output will be 0.
In test case 2:
N=14, the divisors of 14 are 1,2,7,14.
The first team will have 2 members corresponding to divisors 2 and 14.
The second team will have 2 members corresponding to divisors 1 and 7.
Since the teams have the same number of members, the output will be 1.

A thermal decomposition reaction is breakdown of a compound into one or more compounds when heated.
For example, P→a⋅Q+b⋅R is a decomposition reaction. Here, 1 unit of P is converted into a unit of Q and b unit of R after completion of the reaction.
You are given N compounds numbered from 1 to N. The initial amount of the ith compound is Qi. 
You are also given M equations. Every equation is of the form: 
C0→W1⋅C1+W2⋅C2+…+WX⋅CX.
Here:

C0 represents the compound which will decompose into X compounds on heating.
Ci (1≤i≤X) represents the compounds into which C0 is decomposed.
Wi (1≤i≤X) represents the number of units of Ci produced due to the decomposition of C0.
Ci>Ci−1 for all (1≤i≤X).

Note that a compound can decompose in at most one way only.
Find the final amount of each compound after prolonged heating. Since the number can be huge, print the answer modulo 109+7.
Input Format

First line will contain two space separated integers N and M - the number of compounds and the number of equations.
Second line will contain N space separated integers Q1,Q2,...,QN - the initial amounts of each compound.
The next 2⋅M lines contain the details of the M equations.  Each equation is represented using 2 lines.
First line of the ith equation contains two space separated integers Ci,0, Xi - the decomposing compound and the number of compounds in which it decomposes.
Second line of the ith equation contains 2⋅Xi space separated integers Wi,1,Ci,1,Wi,2,Ci,2,…,Wi,Xi,Ci,Xi - the number of units and the types of compounds into which Ci,0 decomposes. 

Output Format
Print N lines. The ith line contains a single integer denoting the final amount of the ith compound after prolonged heating modulo 109+7.
Constraints

0≤M<N≤105
0≤Qi<(109+7)

Explanation
Test Cse 1: We have 4 compounds initially. For better explanation, we refer the compounds 1,2,3, and 4 as A1,A2,A3, and A4 respectively. Initially, the amount of A1,A2,A3, and A4 present is 5,10,12, and 2 respectively.
The two equations are:

A1→3⋅A2+4⋅A3
A3→2⋅A4

We know that 1 unit of A1 produces 3 units of A2 and 4 units of A3. Thus, the initial 5 units of A1 decompose to 5⋅3=15 units of A2 and 5⋅4=20 units of A3. Note that now there are 0 units of A1 left.
Considering only this reaction, the updated amounts of chemicals would be [0,10+15,12+20,2]=[0,25,32,2].
We also know that 1 unit of A3 decomposes to 2 units of A4. The total amount of A3 available for decomposition would be 32 units (12 units were available initially and 20 units were formed due to decomposition). Thus these 32 units would produce 32⋅2=64 units of A4.
Thus, after prolonged heating, the amounts of compounds are [0,25,0,64+2]=[0,25,0,66].

A battle is going to begin in the kingdom of Airland. There are N soldiers in the kingdom, numbered 1 through N and standing in a circle in such a way that for each valid i, the soldier directly to the right of the i-th soldier is soldier i+1, and the soldier directly to the right of the N-th soldier is soldier 1.
Each soldier holds a sword and a shield. The sword is used to attack other soldiers and the shield is used to defend from attacks. Let's denote the attack value of the i-th soldier's sword by ai and the defense value of the i-th soldier's shield by di.
In the battle, each soldier picks one of the soldiers standing to his left and right, and attacks that soldier. The choices of the soldiers are completely independent, so each soldier can be attacked by the soldier to his left, by the soldier to his right (the power of such an attack is the attack value of the attacking soldier's sword), by both of them (then, the power of the resulting attack is the sum of the attack values of these soldiers' swords) or by nobody. A soldier remains alive if the defense value of his shield is strictly greater than the power with which he is attacked. Everyone attacks simultaneously and there is only one round of attacks. Each soldier that remains alive at the end is awarded a laurel.
The king of Airland likes these fights, so the host of the battle promised the king that he can pick one soldier and if the soldier he picks survives the battle, the king receives the shield of that soldier.
Chef is the deputy of the king and you want to help him pick a soldier for the king in such a way that the king receives the best shield (with the greatest defense value). However, if Chef picks a soldier and that soldier does not survive, Chef will be thrown in a snake pit. Therefore, it should be guaranteed that the chosen soldier will survive regardless of the decisions of the other soldiers.
Can you help Chef make the best choice and tell him the defense value of the shield which the king gets, or decide that he can be thrown in the snake pit no matter which soldier he picks?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers d1,d2,…,dN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the best defense value of the shield the king gets, or −1 if Chef can be thrown in the snake pit.

Explanation
Example case 1: Soldier 1 can be attacked by soldier 2 and/or soldier 4. If only soldier 2 attacks him, the power of the attack is 1. If only soldier 4 attacks him, the power of the attack is 1 again. If they attack together, the power of the attack is 2. In each of these cases, soldier 1 will live.
Soldier 2 can be attacked by soldier 3, with attack power 4. His shield has defense value 4, which is not enough, so in this case, soldier 2 would die. The best safe choice is soldier 1, with defense value 3.
Example case 2: No soldier is guaranteed to survive the battle, so the answer is −1.

An encoder encodes the first 1616 lowercase English letters using 44 bits each. The first bit (from the left) of the code is 00 if the letter lies among the first 88 letters, else it is 11, signifying that it lies among the last 88 letters. The second bit of the code is 00 if the letter lies among the first 44 letters of those 88 letters found in the previous step, else it's 11, signifying that it lies among the last 44 letters of those 88 letters. Similarly, the third and the fourth bit each signify the half in which the letter lies. 
For example, the letter jj would be encoded as :

Among (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h || i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p)i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p), jj appears in the second half. So the first bit of its encoding is 11.
Now, among (i,j,k,l(i,j,k,l || m,n,o,p)m,n,o,p), jj appears in the first half. So the second bit of its encoding is 00.
Now, among (i,j(i,j || k,l)k,l), jj appears in the first half. So the third bit of its encoding is 00.
Now, among (i(i || j)j), jj appears in the second half. So the fourth and last bit of its encoding is 11.

So jj's encoding is 10011001,
Given a binary encoded string SS, of length at most 105105, decode the string. That is, the first 4 bits are the encoding of the first letter of the secret message, the next 4 bits encode the second letter, and so on. It is guaranteed that the string's length is a multiple of 4.
Input:

The first line of the input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, the length of the encoded string.
The second line of each test case contains the encoded string SS.

Output:
For each test case, print the decoded string, in a separate line.
Constraints

4≤N≤1054≤N≤105
The length of the encoded string is a multiple of 44.

Explanation

Sample Case 11 : 

The first bit is 00, so the letter lies among the first 88 letters, i.e., among a,b,c,d,e,f,g,ha,b,c,d,e,f,g,h. The second bit is 00, so it lies among the first four of these, i.e., among a,b,c,da,b,c,d. 
The third bit is 00, so it again lies in the first half, i.e., it's either aa or bb. Finally, the fourth bit is also 00, so we know that the letter is aa.

Sample Case 22 : 

Each four bits correspond to a character. Just like in sample case 11, 00000000 is equivalent to aa. Similarly, 11111111 is equivalent to pp. So, the decoded string is apap.

Sample Case 33 : 

The first bit is 11, so the letter lies among the last 88 letters, i.e., among i,j,k,l,m,n,o,pi,j,k,l,m,n,o,p. The second bit is 00, so it lies among the first four of these, i.e., among i,j,k,li,j,k,l. 
The third bit is 00, so it again lies in the first half, i.e., it's either ii or jj. Finally, the fourth bit is 11, so we know that the letter is jj.

Chef was recently watching Modi Ji's speech and he had a perfect array of integers with him. A perfect array is one in which sum of odd index elements equals the sum of even index elements.
As soon as Modi Ji announced the lockdown, he was shocked and lost one of the elements in the array. So, it is quite possible that the array is no longer perfect.
He needs your help. You are given an array of N integers. You need to add exactly one integer in the beginning of the array so that it becomes perfect.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of test case contains an integer N.
Next line contains N space seperated integers, A0, A1, … , An−1.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the integer value to be added at the beginning of the array.

Numeros the Artist had two lists that were permutations of one another. He was very proud. Unfortunately, while transporting them from one exhibition to another, some numbers were lost out of the first list. Can you find the missing numbers?
As an example, the array with some numbers missing, arr=[7,2,5,3,5,3]arr=[7,2,5,3,5,3]. The original array of numbers brr=[7,2,5,4,6,3,5,3]brr=[7,2,5,4,6,3,5,3]. The numbers missing are [4,6][4,6].
Notes:

If a number occurs multiple times in the lists, you must ensure that the frequency of that number in both lists is the same. If that is not the case, then it is also a missing number.
You have to print all the missing numbers in ascending order.
Print each missing number once, even if it is missing multiple times.
The difference between the maximum and minimum number in the second list is less than or equal to 100.
arr: the array with missing numbers
brr: the original array of numbers

Input:
There will be four lines of input:

n, the size of the first list, arr.

Park Street in Kolkata is famous for its mouth watering sweets. There are a total of N  shops in the market, which are extended over a single street with shops following one another. The shops are enumerated from 1 to N, from left to right. The market is unique in the sense that each shop sells only a single type of sweet. Additionally, no two shops sell the same type of sweet. For convenience, the different types of sweets are numbered from 1 to N.
Though the famous market has been running smoothly for many years, the city Mayor decided to have it completely overhauled and aims to make this famous market great again. So he has issued a tender for the shops, which you happened to grab by using your good offices with the Mayor. The tender specifies that you should decide which type of sweet each shop should sell. You would like to do so, while keeping in mind that buyers like purchasing sweets if adjacent shops sell sweets of similar types, because then they can purchase similar type sweets without wandering around many shops. Formally, you would like to minimize the maximum absolute value of difference between the types of sweets in adjacent shops. Two shops which are numbered i and i + 1 (i < N) are said to be adjacent to each other.
The city Mayor himself is very fond of sweets and has decided to have his own shop in the market too. He has chosen shop numbered S in which he will sell sweets of type Q. For the remaining N - 1 shops, you have to assign which sweets should be sold so as to minimize the maximum absolute difference in the type of sweets in adjacent shops.
Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains three space separated integers N, S, Q, denoting number of shops in the market, the shop chosen by the Mayor, and the type of sweet the Mayor's shop sells, respectively.
Output
For each test case, output two lines.
In the first line of each test case, output the minimum value of the maximum difference in the types of sweets of adjacent shops.
In the next line, output N space separated integers denoting the types of sweets sold in each of the shops. If there are multiple answers, output any one.
Constraints

1 ≤ T, N ≤ 500
1 ≤ S, Q ≤ N

Example
Input:
2
3 2 3
2 1 1

Output:
2
1 3 2
1
1 2

Explanation
Example case 1.The city Mayor has decided to sell sweets of type 3 in the second shop. In the first shop, you can decide to sell sweets of type 1 and that of type 2 in the third shop. In this case, maximum difference in the type of sweets of adjacent shops is 2. There can be one other way of assigning sweets with shops, i.e. sell sweets of type 2 in shop 1 and that of type 1 in shop 3. In this case also, maximum difference in type of adjacent shops is 2. So, you can see that in any case, minimum value of maximum difference in type of adjacent shops will be 2. Hence answer is 2.

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
There are N students living in the dormitory of Berland State University. Each of them sometimes wants to use the kitchen, so the head of the dormitory came up with a timetable for kitchen's usage in order to avoid the conflicts:

The first student starts to use the kitchen at the time 0 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A1.
The second student starts to use the kitchen at the time A1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A2.
And so on.
The N-th student starts to use the kitchen at the time AN-1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time AN


The holidays in Berland are approaching, so today each of these N students wants to cook some pancakes. The i-th student needs Bi units of time to cook.
The students have understood that probably not all of them will be able to cook everything they want. How many students will be able to cook without violating the schedule?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of students.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the moments of time by when the corresponding student should finish cooking. 
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BN denoting the time required for each of the students to cook.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of students that will be able to finish the cooking.
Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
0 < A1 <  A2 < ... < AN < 109
1 ≤ Bi ≤ 109

Example
Input:
2
3
1 10 15
1 10 3
3
10 20 30
15 5 20

Output:
2
1

Explanation
Example case 1. The first student has 1 unit of time - the moment 0. It will be enough for her to cook. The second student has 9 units of time, but wants to cook for 10 units of time, and won't fit in time. The third student has 5 units of time and will fit in time, because needs to cook only for 3 units of time.
Example case 2. Each of students has 10 units of time, but only the second one will be able to fit in time.

An operation on an array of size nn shifts each of the array's elements 11 unit to the left. For example, if  22 operations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].   
Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d operations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers. 
Input Format:
The    first   line    contains    two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and d (the number of operations you must perform). 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state. 
Constraints:

1≤n≤105 
1≤d≤n 
1≤ai≤106 where ai is the ith element of array   

Output Format:
Print a single    line    of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d operations. 
Sample Input:
5 4
1 2 3 4 5   
Sample Output:
5 1 2 3 4
Explanation:
When we perform d=4 operations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:   
[1,2,3,4,5]→[2,3,4,5,1]→[3,4,5,1,2]→[4,5,1,2,3]→[5,1,2,3,4] 
Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated    values,
which is 5 1 2 3 4.

Each candy can be given to only one elephant. Print Yes if it is possible and No otherwise.

Input
The first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and C, the total number of elephants and the total number of candies in the Zoo respectively. The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.

Output
For each test case output exactly one line containing the string Yes if it possible to make all elephants happy and the string No otherwise. Output is case sensitive. So do not print YES or yes.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ C ≤ 109
1 ≤ AK ≤ 10000, for K = 1, 2, ..., N

                        Sample Output 1
                        





Yes
No


Explanation
Case 1. We can give one candy to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant and make them both happy. Hence the answer is Yes. Alternatively we can give one candy to each elephant and left one candy for ourselves but they again will be happy.

Case 2. Even if we give four candies to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant we will have only one candy left and can not make last elephant happy since he needs two candies for his happiness. Hence the answer is No.

Chef is playing with balls of two colours one red and another green.There is a machine named "Chef Game Machine" in which all the balls are kept. Chef Game Machine is having a button which when press, it shuffles and puts all the balls in a row(numbered from 1 to N).One row will contain only one ball.Let's denote red ball with '1' and green ball with '0'.
Game is that one need to find the maximum contiguous length of red balls by replacing at most one green ball in the row after shuffling. Chef can win the game if he finds the correct length of contiguous red balls by replacing at most one green ball
For example after shuffling the arrangement of ball is like this 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0  if you replace green ball at 7th place by red ball then you will get  1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 here maximun contiguous red ball length is 5(from index 5 to index 9 ). 

  Now Chef wants to win every time so he ask you to find the longest contiguous  red balls length after replacing one green ball the row.

 Note : You may or may not replace green ball. 

Input  

 First line of test case will contains T, number of test cases. T lines follows. 
 First line of every test case will contain the length N of the row. 
 Second line will contains N space separated 1s and 0s.
 

 Output  

 Output will print a single integer denoting the maximum contiguous length possible after replacing on green ball.

Chef has a non-decreasing array A of N elements. Since Chef was getting bored in his holidays, he was wondering how many subarrays exist in the array, such that the arithmetic mean (avergae) of the subarray is less than the integer K. As the number of such subarrays can be a lot, Chef is asking for your help to exhaust his curiosity. 

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. A single element is also considered a subarray. For example, [3], [4] and [3, 4, 5] are some of the subarrays of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Two subarrays are different if their start or/and end indices are different. 

 
Input
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers in non-decreasing order A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output
Output one integer, the number of subarrays who has mean strictly less than K. Note that this number exceed the maximum of what a C++ integer can hold. 


Subtasks

1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109 for all subtasks

Subtask 1(10 points): All numbers in the array are the same
Subtask 2(30 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 103, 1 ≤ K ≤ 103
Subtask 3(60 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 106, 1 ≤ K ≤ 109
 
Example
Input:
5 4
2 2 3 5 6 

Output:
9

 
Explanation
 The subarrays are: [2], [2], [3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

A football competition has just finished. The players have been given points for scoring goals and points for committing fouls. Now, it is up to Alex to find the best player in the tournament. As a programmer, your job is to help Alex by telling him the highest number of points achieved by some player.
You are given two sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN. For each valid ii, player ii scored Ai goals and committed Bi fouls. For each goal, the player that scored it gets 20 points, and for each foul, 10 points are deducted from the player that committed it. However, if the resulting number of points of some player is negative, this player will be considered to have 0 points instead.
You need to calculate the total number of points gained by each player and tell Alex the maximum of these values.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Chef likes to play with array elements. His teacher has given him an array problem. But now he is busy as Christmas is coming. So, he needs your help. Can you help him to solve this problem.
You are given an array (A1,A2,A3……AN)(A1,A2,A3……AN) of length NN. You have to create an another array using the given array in the following ways:
For each valid i, the ith element of the output array will be the sum of the ith element and (A[i])th element if A[i]A[i] is less equal N.
Other wise for each valid i following the step below
i) Divide the value of A[i] by 2 untill it will be less thanN.
ii) then find the difference (D) between N and A[i].
iii) the ith element of the output array will be Dth element.  
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.  
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.   

Output:

For each testcase, print new array in each line.

Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105
1≤A1,A2.....AN≤107

Sample Input:
2
5
2 4 5 7 9
4
5 4 2 3
Sample Output:
6 11 14 4 2
4 7 6 5
EXPLANATION:
For 1st test case: A1 = 2+4 =6, A2 = 4+7 =11 , A3 = 5+9 =14 , A4 > N (5) ,So A4/2 = 3 then A4 = A[5 -3] , A4=A[2]=4, And A5 =A[1]=2. Then array becomes 6,11,14,4,2.

John likes fighting games a lot. He owns a game called "Fight Club". In this game there are n players playing all the times. Every player has an energy level (Ai). Every day one of the following 2 things happen:

Either one of these players get an energy boost of X, now his energy level increases by X.
Or two players X and Y (with energy levels Ax and Ay) fight against each other and if some player is having energy level strictly greater than the other then he gets all the energy (Ax+Ay) and the energy level of the other player becomes 0. If they have equal energies then it's a draw and nothing happens.


The above game continues for d days. Now you have the information of what happened on each day.

1 i X : ith player gets an energy of X.
2 U V : means the player U and V fight against each other.

After every day you need to print the maximum energy level that any player has (Note that you just need to print energy level, player number does not matter here).
Input

First line will contain 2 integers n and d denoting the number of players in the game and number of days for which the game is played respectively.
Next line contains n integers denoting the initial energy levels of all the players.
Next d lines contain one of the 2 operations mentioned above.

Output
Print d lines with each integer(ith) denoting the Maximum energy level after the ith day.
Constraints

1 <= n,d <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 109
1 <= i, U, V <= n
1 <= X <= 109

Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a matrix of integers AA with NN rows (numbered 11 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). Each element of this matrix is either 0 or 1.
A move consists of the following steps:

Choose two different rows r1 and r2 or two different columns c1 and c2.
Apply the bitwise OR operation with the second row/column on the first row/column. Formally, if you chose two rows, this means you should change Ar1,k to Ar1,k∨Ar2,k for each 1≤k≤M; if you chose two columns, then you should change Ak,c1 to Ak,c1∨Ak,c2 for each 1≤k≤N.

For each element of the matrix, compute the minimum number of moves required to make it equal to 1 or determine that it is impossible. Note that these answers are independent, i.e. we are starting with the initial matrix for each of them.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains M integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,M NOT separated by spaces.

Output
For each test case, print N lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain M space-separated integers; for each valid j, the j-th of these integers should be the minimum number of moves required to make Ai,j equal to 1, or −1 if it is impossible.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N,M≤1,000
Ai,j∈{0,1} for each valid i,j
the sum of N⋅M for all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000

You are at a party of NN people, where only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be presentmay be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone at the party. Your task is to find the stranger(guest) at the party.   
You will be given a square matrix M where if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means the ith person knows the jth person. You need to find the 1≤id≤N of the guest if present, otherwise print −1.   
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of 2 lines.

The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of people at the party.   
Next N lines contain N2 integers of the matrix M, where each line contains N integers.

Output Format:
For each test case, print the id of the celebrity if present. Otherwise, print "-1".

Explanation:
For 1st test case, given matrix M as:
0 1 0
0 0 0
0 1 0
The first row denotes the connection for 1st person and similarly for others. It is clear from the matrix that the 1st person knows only 2nd person. Also 3rd person knows only the 2nd person.
Here, the 2nd person is the guest because every other person knows him and he doesn't knows anyone. Therefore, 2 is printed on a new line.

Chef has an array AA of length NN. He defines the alternating sum of the array as:

S=|A1|−|A2|+|A3|−|A4|+…(−1)N−1⋅|AN|S=|A1|−|A2|+|A3|−|A4|+…(−1)N−1⋅|AN|

Chef is allowed to perform the following operation on the array at most once:

Choose two indices i and j (1≤i<j≤N) and swap the elements Ai and Aj.

Find the maximum alternating sum Chef can achieve by performing the operation at most once.
Note: |X| denotes the absolute value of X. For example, |−4|=4 and |7|=7.
Input Format

The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains a single integer N - size of the array A.
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers - denoting the elements of array A.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line, the maximum alternating sum Chef can obtain by performing the operation at most once.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test Case 1: One optimal way is to perform no operations. Thus the alternating sum is |10|−|−10|=10−10=0.
Test Case 2: One optimal way is to choose i=2 and j=5. After swapping, the array is [−3,1,−1,0,−2,2,3]. The alternating sum in this case is |−3|−|1|+|−1|−|0|+|−2|−|2|+|3|=6.

Read problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is participating in a pogo stick race. In this competition, there are N squares (numbered 1 through N) in a row. Chef must choose a starting square, enter this square and start jumping on his pogo stick. In each jump, if Chef is at a square s, then he can only jump to the square s+K. If square s+K does not exist, Chef jumps out of the row of squares and the race ends for him. It is not allowed to stop jumping any earlier.
Each square has a value; let's denote the value of the i-th square by Ai. Initially, Chef has 0 points. When he jumps in some square (including the initial square), he is awarded a number of points equal to the value of this square, exactly once. Note that if this value is negative, the number of Chef's points is decreased.
Determine the maximum possible total number of points Chef can get if he selects the initial cell optimally.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of points.

It's Christmas time, Santa's friends are helping him to arrange the gifts. Franklin is a new member of Santa's group and he too help the others in arranging the gifts. Let n be the number of gifts. Santa has a unique technique of ordering ,he put a number on each gift and then he  write the order of the gifts on a piece of paper and give it to his friends .But Franklin being a new member does not know about this technique so he arrange the gifts haphazardly without maintaining the order. But then one of the other member told him about this technique. Franklin finds himself in deep trouble and asks for your help.
You are given the order of the gifts that Santa has given on the paper and also the order by which Franklin arranges the gifts. You have to find the minimum number of swaps required to convert Franklin's order to Santa's. 
Input:
t:  No of test cases
n:  No of gifts
arr: elements written by Santa on the paper
brr: order by which Franklin arranges the gifts  
Output:
t lines containing the minimum no of swaps required to convert brr to arr.  
Constraints:
1<=t<=100
1<=n<=10^5
1<=arr[],brr[]<=10^4  
Sample Input:
2
4
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3
1 3 2
1 3 2   
Sample Output:
2
0  
Explanation:
1st test case-
If we swap 2 and 1 the array brr becomes [1,3,2,4][1,3,2,4] .Now  we have to swap 3 and 2 hence the array becomes [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4].This the number of swaps is 22.
2nd test case:
Both the arrays are equal. So number of swaps is 00.

RiggiRiggi   is a spy of KBIKBI and he is on a secret mission, he is spying an Underworld Don  AnitAnit.
Riggi  is spying him since 5 years and he is not able to find  any evidence against Anit. 
KBI told Riggi they will send him a code string in a special format that will inform him whether he  has continue or return back from mission.
According to KBI  firstly  he  has to find what is the original string and then he has to check string is palindrome or not .
If its a palindrome then he has to leave the mission and return back else continue spying Anit. 
Rules to find original string :
1:-If in Code string any integer(N) followed by a string of alphabets that starts with '+' and  ends with '-' then he has to repeat that string N times  , like 3+acg- = acgacgacg.
2:-If there is no integer present before string then print the string is repeated 1 time.
    like bc=bc.
Example of conversion from  Code string  to original string  : 2+ac-3+kb-j=acackbkbkbj  
Input:

Code string S is taken as input  .

Output:

Print  string Continue if code string S is not a palindrome else print Return .

Constraints

1≤S≤1000
1≤N≤1000

Sample Input 1:
3+xy-bb3+yx-

Sample Output 1:
Return

Sample Input 2:
3+xy-bb3+xy-

Sample Output 2:
Continue

EXPLANATION:
Sample 1:- original string will be xyxyxybbyxyxyx which is  a palindrome hence print Return.
 Sample 2:- original string will be xyxyxybbxyxyxy which is not a palindrome hence print 
                     Continue.

Read problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
Chef and Divyam are playing a game. They start with a rational number XX, such that 0<X<10<X<1.
In each turn, Chef chooses a positive real number YY. Then Divyam either adds or subtracts YY to XX. So XX is replaced with either X+YX+Y or X−YX−Y. If this number becomes 00 or 11, then Chef wins. Otherwise, the game continues.
You are given XX, and you have to determine whether Chef can win in a finite number of moves. More formally, does there exist a finite number NN so that Chef has a strategy that is guaranteed to win in at most NN moves?
Here, XX will be given in the form ABAB, where AA and BB are positive integers, A<BA<B and gcd(A,B)=1gcd(A,B)=1.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers AA and BB.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if Chef can win the game in a finite number of moves and "No" otherwise (without quotes). You can print "Yes" or "No" in any case.
Constraints

Explanation
Test case 1: Chef will choose Y=12Y=12, so whatever Divyam does, the number will become 00 or 11. Hence Chef will win in a finite number of moves. 
Test case 2: No matter what Chef chooses, it can be shown that Divyam can make sure Chef never wins.

Explanation
Test case-1: Following are the subarrays of length ≥2:

Length=2: sum([7,2])=9, sum([2,5])=7
Length=3: sum([7,2,5])=14 

We can see that for each of these subarrays, the sum is not divisible by the length.
Test case-2: Following are the subarrays of length ≥2:

Length=2: sum([3,18])=21, sum([18,11])=29, sum([11,2])=13 
Length=3: sum([3,18,11])=32, sum([18,11,2])=31
Length=4: sum([3,18,11,2])=34

We can see that for each of these subarrays, the sum is not divisible by the length.

Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You want to build a temple for snakes. The temple will be built on a mountain range, which can be thought of as n blocks, where height of i-th block is given by hi. The temple will be made on a consecutive section of the blocks and its height should start from 1 and increase by exactly 1 each time till some height and then decrease by exactly 1 each time to height 1, 
i.e. a consecutive section of 1, 2, 3, .. x-1, x, x-1, x-2, .., 1 can correspond to a temple. Also, heights of all the blocks other than of the temple should have zero height, so that the temple is visible to people who view it from the left side or right side.
You want to construct a temple. For that, you can reduce the heights of some of the blocks. In a single operation, you can reduce the height of a block by 1 unit. Find out minimum number of operations required to build a temple.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n.
The next line contains n integers, where the i-th integer denotes hi
Output
For each test case, output a new line with an integer corresponding to the answer of that testcase.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ hi ≤ 109

Example
Input
3
3
1 2 1
4
1 1 2 1
5
1 2 6 2 1

Output
0
1
3

Explanation
Example 1. The entire mountain range is already a temple. So, there is no need to make any operation.
Example 2. If you reduce the height of the first block to 0. You get 0 1 2 1. The blocks 1, 2, 1 form a temple. So, the answer is 1.
Example 3. One possible temple can be 1 2 3 2 1. It requires 3 operations to build. This is the minimum amount you have to spend in order to build a temple.

Assume you're the owner of "XMAS" Factory located in Udyambag, Belagavi. This XMAS Factory is well known for producing high-quality toy cars including Christmas gifts for kids. These toy cars when turned ON moves forward and autonomously navigates. 
There are MM different types of toy cars. Each type of toy car has NN number cars. There are MM number of machines which produce cars of its corresponding type. For example a "Type 1" machine would produce "Type 1" car only. There is only one machine for each type. Each machine has a special button that reverses the logic of the circuit used in the toy car.  For example, if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move forward when turned ON then by pressing this special button on this machine, the car produced would move backward instead of moving forward similarly, if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move backward when turned ON then by pressing this special button on this machine, the car produced would move forward instead of moving backward thus revering the logic. K is the number of machines in which this special button is turned ON.

A car is said to have correct logic if and only if it moves forward when turned ON.
A car is said to have incorrect logic if it moves backward when turned ON.

The factory has produced M*N number of toy cars. Out of which there are some faulty cars produced with incorrect logic. In order to correct the logic, all the cars are put back into corresponding types of machine. If K is the number of machines in which the special button is turned ON (pressed), you being the owner want to know what maximum number of cars could be produced with correct logic.
Input:

First line will contain single integer T indicating the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains 3 integers namely M, N and K where M is the total number of types of toy cars,  N is the total number of toy cars produced in each type, and K is the exact number of special buttons that will be turned ON.
For each of the next M lines, there is a single integer between 0 and N that indicates the number of cars that are with correct logic.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer indicating the maximum number of toy cars with correct logic.
Constraints

1≤T≤20
1≤K≤M≤106
1≤N≤106

Sample Input 1:
    2
    2 2 1
    2
    0
    2 4 2
    0
    3

Sample Output 1:
    4
    5

EXPLANATION:
There are two test cases in this sample test file.
In the first test case, there are two types of cars with each type having in total 2 number of cars. Since there are two types of cars there would be corresponding two types of machines producing it. In the first type say "Type 1", both the cars have correct logic and in the second type say "Type 2", both the cars have incorrect logic. Since K=1, the special button of the "Type 2" machine can be turned ON to correct the logic of both the "Type 2" cars. Hence all the cars can be implemented with correct logic.
In the second test case, there are two types of cars with each type having in total 4 number of cars. Since there are two types of cars there would be corresponding two types of machines producing it. In the first type say "Type 1"  all the cars have incorrect logic and in the second type say "Type 2", 1 car has incorrect logic and remaining 3 cars have correct logic. Since K = 2, the special button on both the machines must be turned ON. As a result, the number of cars with correct logic implemented are 4 from "Type 1" and 1 from "Type 2"

Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an array of NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and three more integers X,p,X,p, and k.
An operation on the array is defined to be: replace the k-th smallest integer in the array with any integer you want.
Output the minimum number of operations you must perform on the array (possibly 0 operations) to make the p-th smallest  element of the array equal to X. If it is impossible to do so output −1.
Note: the k-th smallest number in an array is the k-th number from the left when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four integers N,X,p,k respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of operations you must perform to make X the p-th smallest element or −1 if its impossible to do so.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤p,k≤N
0≤X≤109
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 4∗105
0≤Ai≤109 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N≤5
Subtask #2 (40 points): The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3∗103
Subtask #3 (50 points): Original constraints

                        Sample Output 1
                        





1
-1


Explanation
Example case 1:

We can perform one operation in the array. Take the k-th smallest integer of the current array (which is 8 in this case) and replace it with 0. The array then becomes [4,9,7,0,0] which now makes 4 as the 3rd smallest number of the array.

Example case 2:

It is impossible to make 25 as the smallest number of the array.

In the cursed land of earth where all crops are failing, Tom Cooper is trying to grow n acres of crop this season, and he can grow one crop in an acre. Tom has two sets of n crop seeds each. In the two sets, the two ith crop seeds are the same type crop.
The first set of n crop seeds are independent and each of them require their own preparation and can be grown independently. The ith crop under this category will take a cost of xi.
The second set of n crops are genetically modified to withstand extreme conditions and even withstand the intense dust storms. But there is one thing: to allot a proper usage of resources, the crops are designed in such a way that the ith crop can be directly grown without fertiliser or other resource if the genetically modified (i−1)th crop is grown: that is, for example, the waste material of the (i−1)th crop can be fertiliser for the ith crop, etc. Thus he can grow the ith crop in them in a constant c cost along with a preparation cost of cki but if he has also grown the (i−1)th genetically modified crop, he can skip the preparation cost and grow the ith crop in just c cost.
Since the world market expects a lot of variety in the crops available, Tom wants to maximize the number of different types of crops he grows. That is for example, Tom can grow only genetically modified crop 1 on all his fields. In that case, he grows 1 crop. Tom wants to maximize this number of crops he grows. Note that growing both genetically modified and normal versions of the same crop count as growing 1 crop only, and not 2.
Thus, Tom wants you to find out the maximum number of different crops he can grow, and the corresponding minimum cost at which he can grow n sets of crops.
Input format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains two numbers n and c.
The second line has n integers x1,x2,…,xn.
The third line has n integers k1,k2,…,kn.

Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤n≤104
1≤c≤109
1≤x[i]≤109
1≤k[i]≤10

Output format
For each test case, output a line having two integers - the maximum number of different crops that can be grown, and the minimum cost that'll be taken for this set of crops.

Jumping Jack is new to the Heroic Society.He is so obsessed with jumping that he can do it the whole day without getting tired
Jumping Jack likes challenges a lot, and he is challenged by the beautiful Cho Chang to jump a river.
Since Jumping Jack can't jump the river in a single leap, Cho Chang gave him N magical leaves which will float on water.
Jumping Jack arranged the leaves in a stright line on the water's surface.
The last leaf arraged by Jumping Jack represents the bank of the river. If Jumping Jack can reach the last leaf then it means that 
  can cross the river.

Jumping jack has three different style of jumping which are as follows:

Jump one step forward
Jump two steps forward 
Jump three steps forward 

But there's a twist in the game.Cho Chang unknowingly gave him some pseudo-magical leaves.
If Jumping Jack steps on any pseudo-magical leaf he will drown.
You are given the information about the leaves arranged by Jumping Jack in the form of an array A.
A[i] is Zero if the leaf is magical and One if it is pseudo-magical
Find out whether it is possible for Jumping Jack to cross the river or not,
if YES then the minimum leaps required by him to cross the river.
if NOthen print "Never Give Up" without quotes.
Note: Reaching the last leaf is considered as crossing the river. If Jumping Jack can't reach the last leaf then he can't cross the river
Initially Jumping Jack is standing on the first leaf.

 
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
   The description of T test cases follows.
   First line of each test case contains an integer N
   Second line contains N space separated integers denoting whether the leaf is magical(0) or pseudo-magical(1)
 
Output
For each test case output one single line the minimum number of leaps required to cross the river if it is possible.
  If it is not possible to cross the river then print "Never Give Up" without quotes

 The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
 The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
 The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.


Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:



Round
Player 1
Player 2


1
140
82


2
89
134


3
90
110


4
112
106


5
88
90



The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:


Round
Player 1
Player 2
Leader
Lead


1
140
82
Player 1
58


2
229
216
Player 1
13


3
319
326
Player 2
7


4
431
432
Player 2
1


5
519
522
Player 2
3


Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
 The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
 Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
 The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
≤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 ≤ Si ≤
1000 and 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000.  
Output
 Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese,Russian and Vietnamese as well.
The snakes want to build a temple for Lord Cobra. There are multiple strips of land that they are looking at, but not all of them are suitable. They need the strip of land to resemble a coiled Cobra. You need to find out which strips do so.
Formally, every strip of land, has a length. Suppose the length of the i-th strip is is Ni, then there will be Ni integers, Hi1, Hi2, .. HiNi, which represent the heights of the ground at various parts of the strip, in sequential order. That is, the strip has been divided into Ni parts and the height of each part is given. This strip is valid, if and only if all these conditions are satisfied:

There should be an unique 'centre' part. This is where the actual temple will be built. By centre, we mean that there should be an equal number of parts to the left of this part, and to the right of this part.
Hi1 = 1
The heights keep increasing by exactly 1, as you move from the leftmost part, to the centre part.
The heights should keep decreasing by exactly 1, as you move from the centre part to the rightmost part. Note that this means that HiNi should also be 1.

Your job is to look at every strip and find if it's valid or not.
Input

The first line contains a single integer, S, which is the number of strips you need to look at. The description of each of the S strips follows
The first line of the i-th strip's description will contain a single integer: Ni, which is the length and number of parts into which it has been divided.
The next line contains Ni integers: Hi1, Hi2, .., HiNi. These represent the heights of the various parts in the i-th strip.

Output

For each strip, in a new line, output "yes" if is a valid strip, and "no", if it isn't.

Constraints

1 ≤ S ≤ 100 
3 ≤ Ni ≤ 100 
1 ≤ Hij ≤ 100 

Example
Input:
7

1 2 3 2 1

4
1 2 3 2
4
1 2 2 1

Output:
yes
no
no
no
yes
no
no

Explanation
In the first strip, all the conditions are satisfied, hence it is valid.
In the second strip, it does not start with a 1, and hence is invalid.
In the third strip, it keeps increasing even past the centre, instead of decreasing. Hence invalid.
The fourth strip does not increase and decrease by exactly 1. Hence invalid.
The fifth satisfies all conditions and hence is valid.
The sixth and seventh strip do not have a 'centre' part. Because for every part, there are either more parts to its right than its left, or more parts on its left than its right. Hence both the strips are invalid.

Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are participating in a contest which has 1111 problems (numbered 11 through 1111). The first eight problems (i.e. problems 1,2,…,81,2,…,8) are scorable, while the last three problems (9, 10 and 11) are non-scorable ― this means that any submissions you make on any of these problems do not affect your total score.
Your total score is the sum of your best scores for all scorable problems. That is, for each scorable problem, you look at the scores of all submissions you made on that problem and take the maximum of these scores (or 0 if you didn't make any submissions on that problem); the total score is the sum of the maximum scores you took.
You know the results of all submissions you made. Calculate your total score.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of submissions you made.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers pi and si, denoting that your i-th submission was on problem pi and it received a score si.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― your total score.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤1,000
1≤pi≤11 for each valid i
0≤si≤100 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (15 points): all submissions are on the same problem, i.e. p1=p2=…=pN
Subtask #2 (15 points): there is at most one submission made on each problem, i.e. pi≠pj for each valid i,j (i≠j)
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The scorable problems with at least one submission are problems 2 and 8. For problem 2, there are two submissions and the maximum score among them is 45. For problem 8, there are also two submissions and the maximum score is 90. Hence, the total score is 45+90=135.
Example case 2: No scorable problem is attempted, so the total score is 0.

Little kids, Jack and Evan like playing their favorite game Glass-and-Stone. Today they want to play something new and came across Twitter on their father's laptop.

They saw it for the first time but were already getting bored to see a bunch of sentences having at most 140 characters each. The only thing they liked to play with it is, closing and opening tweets.

There are N tweets on the page and each tweet can be opened by clicking on it, to see some statistics related to that tweet. Initially all the tweets are closed. Clicking on an open tweet closes it and clicking on a closed tweet opens it. There is also a button to close all the open tweets. Given a sequence of K clicks by Jack, Evan has to guess the total number of open tweets just after each click. Please help Evan in this game.

Input
First line contains two integers N K, the number of tweets (numbered 1 to N) and the number of clicks respectively (1 ≤ N, K ≤ 1000). Each of the following K lines has one of the following.CLICK X , where X is the tweet number (1 ≤ X ≤ N)
CLOSEALL
Output
Output K lines, where the ith line should contain the number of open tweets just after the ith click.

Explanation
Let open[x] = 1 if the xth tweet is open and 0 if its closed.
Initially open[1..3] = { 0 , 0 , 0 }. Here is the state of open[1..3] after each click and corresponding count of open tweets.
CLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1
CLICK 2 : { 1, 1, 0 }, open count = 2
CLICK 3 : { 1, 1, 1 }, open count = 3
CLICK 2 : { 1, 0, 1 }, open count = 2
CLOSEALL : { 0, 0, 0 }, open count = 0
CLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1

You are given an array AA with length NN. On each day, the following process was performed:

a new array R is created; this array contains all elements Ai such that i=1, i=N or min(Ai−1,Ai+1)≤Ai (2≤i<N), in the original order
A is replaced by R and N is replaced by the length of R

In other words, all elements of A that are between two bigger elements disappear.
For each element of the original array, calculate the number of the day on which it disappeared (the process starts with day 1), or determine that it never disappeared.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the number of the day on which the i-th element of the original array disappeared, or 0 if it never disappeared.

Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.

You are given an array A with size N and a number K. Let's call a position i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) valid if, after increasing Ai by K, it would be greater than the sum of all other elements in the array A.

Determine the number of distinct valid positions.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid positions.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100,000

Explanation

Example case 1: A1 + K = 6 isn't greater than A2 + A3 + A4 = 14, so position 1 isn't valid. A2 + K = 5 isn't greater than A1 + A3 + A4 = 15, so position 2 isn't valid. A3 + K = 10 isn't greater than A1 + A2 + A4 = 10, so position 3 also isn't valid. A4 + K = 11 is greater than A1 + A2 + A3 = 9. Therefore, there is only one valid position — position 4.

Ants have developed advanced ways to find, distribute and make their own food, to such extent that, it has been said that ants eat more meat than lions wolves and tigers combined!
Argentine ant is one of the world’s worst invasive species(Species which are not native to a specific location, but have tendency to spread to a degree to cause damage to the native 
species of a region) present in the Norfolk Island. It forms supercolonies and are aggressive competitors, displacing most other ant species. It can alter ecosystem processes such as 
pollination and seed dispersal of native plant species.
The federal environment department is in its mission to wipe out the species from  Norfolk Island. So, they are carrying out a survey in T sites within the island examinig the 
food sources. They know that the ant species can survive in a site only if the food available is more than K units or else they will eventually die out from the site. For every site, 
they go around the region examining N food sources, and finding A[i], the unit of food available from the ith source(1 ≤ i ≤ N).

Determine for each site, whether the ant species can survive or they die out from the specific site.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers T and K. Then, information of T sites of the island follow.
For each T, the first line contains N, the number of food sources and the second line contains N space-separated integers, A[i] (1 ≤ i 
≤ N).


Output
For each T, output "SUCCESS" without quotes, if the ant species die out or "FAILURE" if the ant species survives.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ K ≤ 1018
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1013


Example Input

Given an array AA consisting of NN non-negative integers. 
You need to perform the following operation (N−1)(N−1) times:

Sort the array A in ascending order.
Let M be the current size of the array A. Replace the array A by [(A2−A1),(A3−A2),…,(AM−AM−1)]. Note that each time the operation is performed, the size of the array reduces by one.

Find the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, output single line: the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤1018
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

1
777


Explanation

Test case 1: The operations look like:
Operation 1: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [0,3,19,29]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(3−0),(19−3),(29−19)]=[3,16,10].
Operation 2: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [3,10,16]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(10−3),(16−10)]=[7,6].
Operation 3: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [6,7]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(7−6)]=[1].

Thus, the remaining element after 3 operations is 1.

Test case 2: Since N=1, you don't need to perform any operation. The remaining element after 0 operations is 777.

Finally the LazyProblemSetters have decided the way in which they will attempt the questions in the problem set. They have decided to go to the Computer Lab of the CSE department (because it has air-conditioning) and are ready to get their hands dirty with some WA's and TLE's.

Their department has a very unique lab. They have a lot of computers and each student gets a private account which they can access through any of those computers. For this, no data is stored on these computers but on dedicated servers and sent to the computer that a student is currently using. This way the students are not forced to sit on particular computers and can choose any place they like that is available.

Now, the department has a home built advanced facial recognition software which they use in this lab. It works as follows:When anyone sits on a computer, his/her picture is captured, (along with the locality) and sent to the internal database of the lab where they identify the user associated with that picture, and the computer he/she is sitting. After that the data of that user is fetched from the dedicated data servers and sent to the computer.

Now, all this takes time, and to keep the user busy, they decided to give them a puzzle to solve. If the user solves the puzzle correctly, they are allowed to login. The puzzle is as follows:


 A string S (composed of only small case letters of the English alphabet) is shown on the screen to the user.
 Then two integers P and Q are shown to the users. 
 The user has now to create a string R using S and P by concatenating P copies of S one after another.
Then R is transformed into its smallest lexicographic permutation i.e. all the "a"'s are brought to the front and placed there, then after that all the "b"'s are placed, then "c"'s and so on. This is the final R that the user needs to form.
 Then Q numbers appear on the screen one by one. For each number N that appears on the screen, the user has to type the character at the Nth location of R. If N is greater than the length of R, they have to type "-1" (without quotes).


Input
The first line consists of an integer T, the number of test cases followed by the test cases themselves. 
Each test case begins with the string S in the first line, followed by two space-separated integers P and Q in the next line. 
Then Q lines follow, each containing an integer N.

Output
For each test case, for each integer N, print in a new line the character at the Nth location of R  or print "-1" (without quotes) as described above. 
Constraints

 1 ≤ P ≤ 107 
 1 ≤ N ≤ 109 
 1 ≤ Q ≤ 105 
 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100, where |S| denotes the length of the string. 
 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 

Example
Input:
1
abcde
3 5
3
4
10
15
16

Output:
a
b
d
e
-1

Note: Large I/O, be careful with certain languages

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an array A, consisting of N integers and an array B, consisting of M integers.
The subsequence of A is the array that can be obtained by picking the elements at the arbitrary sorted set of positions from A.
Your task is to count the number of such subsequences C of A that:

C contains exactly M elements.
The array (C+B) is non-decreasing. Here by + operation, we mean element-wise sum. 
For example, the array (4, 8, 5) plus the array (10, 20, 30) is (14, 28, 35).
Formally, (C+B) is an array of size M such that (C+B)i = Ci + Bi.


In case some subsequence appears more that once, you should counts it as many times as it appears.
Formally, two subarrays of an array a, (ai_1, ai_2, ... ,ai_n) and (aj_1, aj_2, ... ,aj_m) will be considered different if either their lengths are different i.e. n != m or there exists an index k such that such that i_k  != j_k.

Since the answer can be very large, we ask you to calculate it, modulo 109+7.
Input
The first line of input contains a pair of space separated integers N and M, denoting the number of elements in the array A and the number of elements in the array B.
The second line contains N space-separated integers Ai, denoting the array A.
The third line contains M space-separated integers Bj, denoting the array B.
Output
Output a single line containing the number of subsequences C as asked in the problem, modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 109
1 ≤ M ≤ N

Subtasks

Subtask #2 (33 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 500, 1 ≤ M ≤ 50
Subtask #3 (34 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000

Example
Input #1:

1 5 2 4 7
7 9 6

Output #1:
4

Input #2:
4 2
7 7 7 7
3 4

Output #2:
6

Explanation
Example case 1. The suitable subsequences are (1, 2, 7), (1, 4, 7), (5, 4, 7), (2, 4, 7).
Example case 2. The suitable subsequence is (7, 7), and it appears 6 times:

at indices (1, 2)
at indices (1, 3)
at indices (1, 4)
at indices (2, 3)
at indices (2, 4)
at indices (3, 4)


So, the answer is 6.

Explanation
first array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
second array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
third array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].

You are given an integer sequence AA with length NN.
Find the number of (unordered) pairs of elements such that the average of these two elements is also present in the sequence. Formally, find the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N and there is an index k (1≤k≤N) for which 2Ak=Ai+Aj holds.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid pairs (i,j).

Explanation
Example case 1: We can take k for Ak to be either 1 or 2, since Ak=2 either way. Since the problem asks for unordered pairs, (1,2) is the only possible valid pair (the same as (2,1)). Hence, the answer is 1.
Example case 2: We see that A1=2=(1+3)/2. No other valid pair exists.

Agent Chef 
RAW (Indian spy agency) hacked into a terrorist computer which according to 
their intelligence contains information about future terrorist attacks. But there is
a problem that the computer uses a particular encryption technique to safeguard its 
data. That computer gives a token, which consists of space separated elements. These 
elements are numbers each ranging from 0 to 9. It is known this encryption can be broken 
by constructing a number with the given elements in the order given by the computer and
adding the reverse of that number to the original number. The sum so obtained is the key
to break the encryption. This mission to construct the decryption device has been given to
agent Chef. Help the Chef construct this device. 
Input Format: 
First line contains an integer T, representing no. of test cases.
For each of test cases:
First line contains an integer N, representing size of token.
Second line contains N elements of token that are space separated.

Output Format: 
For each test case output will be a token of space separated elements.
Constraints: 
T <= 20
1 <= N <= 1000 
Each element will be a number from 0 to 9
Examples: 
Input
2
6
2 1 4 2 6 7
5
1 3 2 8 0
Output
9 7 6 6 7 9
2 1 5 1 1
Explanation:
First line gives T=2 (2 test cases). 6 in next line means there will be 6 elements in the 
token and the next line has the token itself. Output is 9 7 6 6 7 9 as 214267+762412=976679.
 Similarly, 13280+08231=21511 for the second test case.

The range of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value in it.
Chef comes up with a crazy idea to minimize the range by changing atmost 33 elements in the array. He wants to check whether the minimum range he gets is right or not.
Please help him in verifying his answer.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each test case contains an integer NN, the no. of integers in the array.
Second line contains N space separated integers, A0,A1,...,An−1. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the minimum range.
Constraints

3≤N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109

Sample Input:
1
6
3 5 0 2 10 0

Sample Output:
2

EXPLANATION:
Chef changes the elements 3, 5 and 10 to 0, 1 and 2, resulting in the array: [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0].
The minimum range is 2−0=2. There can be multiple ways to change atmost 3 elements to get the answer.

Read problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.
In Chefland, types of ingredients are represented by integers and recipes are represented by sequences of ingredients that are used when cooking. One day, Chef found a recipe represented by a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN at his front door and he is wondering if this recipe was prepared by him.
Chef is a very picky person. He uses one ingredient jar for each type of ingredient and when he stops using a jar, he does not want to use it again later while preparing the same recipe, so ingredients of each type (which is used in his recipe) always appear as a contiguous subsequence. Chef is innovative, too, so he makes sure that in each of his recipes, the quantity of each ingredient (i.e. the number of occurrences of this type of ingredient) is unique ― distinct from the quantities of all other ingredients.
Determine whether Chef could have prepared the given recipe.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the recipe could have been prepared by Chef or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints

YES
NO
NO


Explanation
Example case 1: For each ingredient type, its ingredient jar is used only once and the quantities of all ingredients are pairwise distinct. Hence, this recipe could have been prepared by Chef. 
Example case 2: The jar of ingredient 4 is used twice in the recipe, so it was not prepared by Chef.

There are NN workers; each worker is of one of the following three types:

A translator translates some text from Chef's language to another langague.
An author writes some text in Chef's language.
An author-translator can both write a text in Chef's language and translate it to another language.

Chef wants to have some text written and translated into some language (different from Chef's language). Chef can't do either of those tasks, but he can hire workers. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), if he hires the ii-th worker, he must pay that worker cici coins.
Help Chef find the minimum total number of coins he needs to pay to have a text written and translated. It is guaranteed that it is possible to write and translate a text.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer NN denoting the number of workers.
The second line contins NN space-separated integers c1,c2,...,cNc1,c2,...,cN denoting the numbers of coins Chef has to pay each hired worker.
The third line contains NN space-separated integers t1,t2,...,tNt1,t2,...,tN denoting the types of workers. For each valid ii, the ii-th worker is a translator if ti=1ti=1, an author if ti=2ti=2 or an author-translator if ti=3ti=3.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of coins Chef has to pay.

One day Chef and his friend Alice decide to build a device which will transfer the data between them. The data is transferred in binary form i.e. 1 & 0. 
When the device was built they tried to test it. While testing the device they found out that due to noise in the data transferring channel they didn’t receive the 
data in exactly the same form, some of the digits of the data were misplaced or missing. So Chef and Alice decided that chef will fine tune the device and send the 
same data to Alice for N number of times and the data with lowest error will be accepted.

Your task is to help Alice find the ith sent data for which the minimum error is received.

Given that %error = (total no of wrong digits / total number of digits) × 100

Input

The first line of input contains two integer N denoting the numbers of times the data was sent and L denoting the length of the data sent. 
The second line contains the correct data which is to be transferred.
Each of the following  N  lines contain the data sent by the device in the ith attempt.


Output
Output a single line containing the string which has the lowest error.
Note:If there are more than one possible output with the same minimum error then output the first string which has the minimum error.


Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 103
1 ≤ L ≤ 103


Example Input:
2 5
11111
10101
11110


Example Output:
11110

One day Chef's friend gave him a sequence a1,a2,a3,a4.....an. He told Chef to find the length of the longest appearing 
Even Sequence. An even sequence is a sequence formed with only consecutive even numbers(e.g. 4 8 2 14 is an even sequence but 4 8 5 14 is not). But the twist is that firstly 
he wants Chef to convert the sequence in a specified form where b1>= b2<=b3 >=b4<=.......... upto n terms and then find the length 
of the longest appearing Even Sequence.
NOTE: If there are multiple sequence possible, take the one that's lexicographically smallest.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer N denoting the numbers of Test Cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of element in the Sequence. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the sequence.


Output
output a single line containing the length of the longest appearing Even Sequence.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105


Example Input
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
6 7 8 10 12 16


Example Output
1
5


Explanation
Example case 1:The given sequence can be converted to 2 1 4 3 5, 5 2 3 1 4 etc.. but we'll take the lexicographically smallest one i.e. 2 1 4 3 5.  
Now we can see the longest appearing Even Sequence in the new sequence is 1.
Example case 2:Similarly as case 1 the lexicographically smallest sequence is 7 6 10 8 16 12 and the lenght of the longest appearing Even sequence is 5.

Chef recently graduated Computer Science in university, so he was looking for a job. He applied for several job offers, but he eventually settled for a software engineering job at ShareChat. Chef was very enthusiastic about his new job and the first mission assigned to him was to implement a message encoding feature to ensure the chat is private and secure.


Chef has a message, which is a string S with length N containing only lowercase English letters. It should be encoded in two steps as follows:

Swap the first and second character of the string S, then swap the 3rd and 4th character, then the 5th and 6th character and so on. If the length of S is odd, the last character should not be swapped with any other.

Replace each occurrence of the letter 'a' in the message obtained after the first step by the letter 'z', each occurrence of 'b' by 'y', each occurrence of 'c' by 'x', etc, and each occurrence of 'z' in the message obtained after the first step by 'a'.



The string produced in the second step is the encoded message. Help Chef and find this message.


Input:


The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.


The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.

The second line contains the message string S.



Output:

For each test case, print a single line containing one string — the encoded message.


Constraints:
1≤T≤1,000

1≤N≤100

|S|=N

S contains only lowercase English letters


Sample Input:

2

9

sharechat

4

chef

Sample Output:
shizxvzsg

sxuv

EXPLANATION:
Example case 1: The original message is "sharechat". In the first step, we swap four pairs of letters (note that the last letter is not swapped), so it becomes "hsraceaht". In the second step, we replace the first letter ('h') by 's', the second letter ('s') by 'h', and so on, so the resulting encoded message is "shizxvzsg".

Saurabh loves to climb mountains, but he climbs the mountain only when the height of the mountains are in increasing order. Now he decided to climb the mountains, but it may be possible that the height of the mountains is not in increasing order.
There are NN mountains, whose heights are H[1],H[2],H[3],...,H[N]H[1],H[2],H[3],...,H[N]. But before climbing the mountains he has to arrange the height of mountains in increasing order.
For doing this he can swap the heights of any two adjacent mountains i.e. H[i]H[i] and H[i+1].
In swapping, the height of H[i] decreases by 1 while the height of H[i+1] increases by 1. This operation can be applied any number of times he wants. Can you help him to find the final sorted order of mountains so that he can climb the mountains?
Input:

The First-line contains an integer N, denoting the number of mountains.
The Second line contains N space-separated integers representing the height of mountains.

Output:
If it is possible to arrange the height of mountains in increasing order, then Print “YES” and Print the sorted height of mountains in the next line. Else Print “NO”.
Constraints

1<=N<=105
1<=H[i]<=105

Sample Input:
5
7 3 9 6 10

Sample Output:
YES
4 6 7 8 10

EXPLANATION:
In the given example [7,3,9,6,10],
he will swap 7 and 3 changing the value of 7 to 6 and 3 to 4, now the heights are [4, 6, 9, 6, 10] and 
Again, he will swap 9 and 6 changing the value of 9 to 8 and 6 to 7, now the heights are [4, 6, 7, 8, 10]. The heights are in Increasing Order.

Chef has recently acquired a job as a professor, but is rather disappointed in his students after evaluating their scores on a test. Chef has N students, and he has a list of marks of all the students, where the ith student has scored Ai marks. The minimum marks required to pass the test is M. If the topper scores less than M, Chef has decided to quit his job. Can you help Chef find out the score of the topper of the test?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains the number of Chef's students N and the minimum pass marks M.

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the scores of the students.


Output
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer which is the maximum score in the test if that score is not less than M. If it is less then M, print "RESIGN" (without quotes).


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 100
1 ≤ M ≤ 50

Example
Input:
2

Arya's birthday is here and he has received many gifts. He has received a total of N gifts from his N friends. Each of these friends has gifted him with K numbers.


Now, for each of these gifts he received, Arya has calculated the XOR of all the numbers in the i-th gift.

Furthermore, he found the bitwise AND, S of all these XOR values.
Since he hates being the center of attention in a party, he has decided to minimize the value of S. However, so as not to seem rude, he can only toggle at most one bit at any position of a number in any gift that he recieved.

Since, Arya is busy managing his guests, he needs your help to find the minimum value of S.

 
Input
The first lint contains T,the number of test cases.
The first line of each test cases contains two space separated integers, N and K.
The subsequent N lines contain K space separated integers G[i] denoting each number gifted by that friend.


 
Output
Print T lines, where each line contains the answer to the corresponding test case.

Constraints
1 ≤ T≤ 1000 
1 ≤ N,K≤ 1000 
1 ≤ G[i]≤ (2^10)-1
 
Example
Input:

1
2 2
1 2
3 4


Output:

1

 
Explanation
Example case 1.

XOR of all values in the first row: 3

XOR of all values in the second row: 7


On toggling the 2nd (from the right) bit of the first gift of the first friend, the minimum answer is received.


XOR of all values in the first row: 1

XOR of all values in the second row: 7


1 AND 7 = 1.

Sachin always loves to play with very large number. He spends most of his time in dealing with very large numbers. One day, he 
and his friend Harry went to hill station. Even at the hill station, Sachin counts different staffs and power them with some
fixed number. Harry got irritated with his behavior. So he gave him a set of two numbers (a and b) and told him to find 
out the number a^b where ^ represents exponentiation operator but since they are at hill station so they don't have any paper
so he just asked him to write the number in his palm after ignoring the first n-1 digits where n is number of digits in a^b 
where a and b are very large number.

Shini has n toys on the shelf of her room. Each of her Toys have a name. When she tried to arrange them in 
alphabetical order, she realized that the names of all her toys start with either K,M or L. If Shini arranges
 all her toys in a random order (not in the alphabetical order) then find the least number of her toys that
 can be taken off the shelf so that no two adjacent toys have names starting with the same letter.

 
Input
The first lint contains T,the number of test cases.
The first line of each test cases contains integer n — the number of toys on the shelf.
The next line contains string s, which represents the first letter of each toy in order. We'll consider
 the toys in the row numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Then the i-th character s equals "K", if th
 e i-th toy's name starts with K, "L", if it starts with L and "M", if it starts with M. 

 
Output
For each test cases print a single integer — the answer to the problem 
Constraints
1 ≤ T≤ 1000 
1 ≤ N≤ 100000 
 
Example
Input:

1

MLLKL

Output:

1

 
Explanation
Example case 1.
In the given test case there are two adjacent toys whose names start with L. If any one of
 those toys are removed then it is seen that the order of toys is MLKL and hence no two adjacent toys have the same name.

Explanation
In the first test case since we have only 2 flavors,flavor 1 is occuring 3 times and 2 is occuring 2 times.
The maximum subsegment of pastries is of flavor 1 which is 3.
In the second case we have 5 pastries and 3 flavors but the third flavor is not in the list hence whole array is valid answer.

Our Chef is hosting a cooking competition in which only two teams can compete at the same time. Both sides should have an equal number of participants to make the competition engaging and fair. Chef was given the duty of forming the two teams as an organizer.
There are various conditions for forming teams. He will be assigned a number 'N' for each competition, and for each divisor 'D' of 'N' (including 1 and 'N' itself), he will add a member:
1) If 'D' is even, go to the first team.
2) if 'D' is odd, go to the second team.
Chef needs your assistance with the event planning because he is quite busy. Your job is to advise the chef whether or not he can make two teams with the same amount of members.
For Example:
For ‘N’ = 10,
The divisors are:
1, 2, 5, 10.
The first team will have two members corresponding to even divisors 2 and 10.
The second team will have two members corresponding to odd divisors 1 and 5.
So, in this case, Chef can make two teams.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the number given to Chef.

Output Format
For each test case print 1 if Chef can make two teams of equal members with the given ‘N’, else print 0.
Output for each test case will be printed in a separate line.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases doesn’t exceed 10^5.

Explanation
In test case 1:
N = 7, the divisors of 7 are 1,7.
The first team will have 0 members since there are no even divisors.
The second team will have 2 members corresponding to divisors 1 and 7.
Since the teams have a different number of members, the output will be 0.
In test case 2:
N=14, the divisors of 14 are 1,2,7,14.
The first team will have 2 members corresponding to divisors 2 and 14.
The second team will have 2 members corresponding to divisors 1 and 7.
Since the teams have the same number of members, the output will be 1.

A thermal decomposition reaction is breakdown of a compound into one or more compounds when heated.
For example, P→a⋅Q+b⋅R is a decomposition reaction. Here, 1 unit of P is converted into a unit of Q and b unit of R after completion of the reaction.
You are given N compounds numbered from 1 to N. The initial amount of the ith compound is Qi. 
You are also given M equations. Every equation is of the form: 
C0→W1⋅C1+W2⋅C2+…+WX⋅CX.
Here:

C0 represents the compound which will decompose into X compounds on heating.
Ci (1≤i≤X) represents the compounds into which C0 is decomposed.
Wi (1≤i≤X) represents the number of units of Ci produced due to the decomposition of C0.
Ci>Ci−1 for all (1≤i≤X).

Note that a compound can decompose in at most one way only.
Find the final amount of each compound after prolonged heating. Since the number can be huge, print the answer modulo 109+7.
Input Format

First line will contain two space separated integers N and M - the number of compounds and the number of equations.
Second line will contain N space separated integers Q1,Q2,...,QN - the initial amounts of each compound.
The next 2⋅M lines contain the details of the M equations.  Each equation is represented using 2 lines.
First line of the ith equation contains two space separated integers Ci,0, Xi - the decomposing compound and the number of compounds in which it decomposes.
Second line of the ith equation contains 2⋅Xi space separated integers Wi,1,Ci,1,Wi,2,Ci,2,…,Wi,Xi,Ci,Xi - the number of units and the types of compounds into which Ci,0 decomposes. 

Output Format
Print N lines. The ith line contains a single integer denoting the final amount of the ith compound after prolonged heating modulo 109+7.
Constraints

Explanation
Test Cse 1: We have 4 compounds initially. For better explanation, we refer the compounds 1,2,3, and 4 as A1,A2,A3, and A4 respectively. Initially, the amount of A1,A2,A3, and A4 present is 5,10,12, and 2 respectively.
The two equations are:

A1→3⋅A2+4⋅A3
A3→2⋅A4

We know that 1 unit of A1 produces 3 units of A2 and 4 units of A3. Thus, the initial 5 units of A1 decompose to 5⋅3=15 units of A2 and 5⋅4=20 units of A3. Note that now there are 0 units of A1 left.
Considering only this reaction, the updated amounts of chemicals would be [0,10+15,12+20,2]=[0,25,32,2].
We also know that 1 unit of A3 decomposes to 2 units of A4. The total amount of A3 available for decomposition would be 32 units (12 units were available initially and 20 units were formed due to decomposition). Thus these 32 units would produce 32⋅2=64 units of A4.
Thus, after prolonged heating, the amounts of compounds are [0,25,0,64+2]=[0,25,0,66].

An encoder encodes the first 1616 lowercase English letters using 44 bits each. The first bit (from the left) of the code is 00 if the letter lies among the first 88 letters, else it is 11, signifying that it lies among the last 88 letters. The second bit of the code is 00 if the letter lies among the first 44 letters of those 88 letters found in the previous step, else it's 11, signifying that it lies among the last 44 letters of those 88 letters. Similarly, the third and the fourth bit each signify the half in which the letter lies. 
For example, the letter jj would be encoded as :

Among (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h || i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p)i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p), jj appears in the second half. So the first bit of its encoding is 11.
Now, among (i,j,k,l(i,j,k,l || m,n,o,p)m,n,o,p), jj appears in the first half. So the second bit of its encoding is 00.
Now, among (i,j(i,j || k,l)k,l), jj appears in the first half. So the third bit of its encoding is 00.
Now, among (i(i || j)j), jj appears in the second half. So the fourth and last bit of its encoding is 11.

So jj's encoding is 10011001,
Given a binary encoded string SS, of length at most 105105, decode the string. That is, the first 4 bits are the encoding of the first letter of the secret message, the next 4 bits encode the second letter, and so on. It is guaranteed that the string's length is a multiple of 4.
Input:

The first line of the input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN, the length of the encoded string.
The second line of each test case contains the encoded string SS.

Output:
For each test case, print the decoded string, in a separate line.

Explanation

Sample Case 11 : 

The first bit is 00, so the letter lies among the first 88 letters, i.e., among a,b,c,d,e,f,g,ha,b,c,d,e,f,g,h. The second bit is 00, so it lies among the first four of these, i.e., among a,b,c,da,b,c,d. 
The third bit is 00, so it again lies in the first half, i.e., it's either aa or bb. Finally, the fourth bit is also 00, so we know that the letter is aa.

Sample Case 22 : 

Each four bits correspond to a character. Just like in sample case 11, 00000000 is equivalent to aa. Similarly, 11111111 is equivalent to pp. So, the decoded string is apap.

Sample Case 33 : 

The first bit is 11, so the letter lies among the last 88 letters, i.e., among i,j,k,l,m,n,o,pi,j,k,l,m,n,o,p. The second bit is 00, so it lies among the first four of these, i.e., among i,j,k,li,j,k,l. 
The third bit is 00, so it again lies in the first half, i.e., it's either ii or jj. Finally, the fourth bit is 11, so we know that the letter is jj.

Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
A battle is going to begin in the kingdom of Airland. There are N soldiers in the kingdom, numbered 1 through N and standing in a circle in such a way that for each valid i, the soldier directly to the right of the i-th soldier is soldier i+1, and the soldier directly to the right of the N-th soldier is soldier 1.
Each soldier holds a sword and a shield. The sword is used to attack other soldiers and the shield is used to defend from attacks. Let's denote the attack value of the i-th soldier's sword by ai and the defense value of the i-th soldier's shield by di.
In the battle, each soldier picks one of the soldiers standing to his left and right, and attacks that soldier. The choices of the soldiers are completely independent, so each soldier can be attacked by the soldier to his left, by the soldier to his right (the power of such an attack is the attack value of the attacking soldier's sword), by both of them (then, the power of the resulting attack is the sum of the attack values of these soldiers' swords) or by nobody. A soldier remains alive if the defense value of his shield is strictly greater than the power with which he is attacked. Everyone attacks simultaneously and there is only one round of attacks. Each soldier that remains alive at the end is awarded a laurel.
The king of Airland likes these fights, so the host of the battle promised the king that he can pick one soldier and if the soldier he picks survives the battle, the king receives the shield of that soldier.
Chef is the deputy of the king and you want to help him pick a soldier for the king in such a way that the king receives the best shield (with the greatest defense value). However, if Chef picks a soldier and that soldier does not survive, Chef will be thrown in a snake pit. Therefore, it should be guaranteed that the chosen soldier will survive regardless of the decisions of the other soldiers.
Can you help Chef make the best choice and tell him the defense value of the shield which the king gets, or decide that he can be thrown in the snake pit no matter which soldier he picks?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers d1,d2,…,dN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the best defense value of the shield the king gets, or −1 if Chef can be thrown in the snake pit.

Explanation
Example case 1: Soldier 1 can be attacked by soldier 2 and/or soldier 4. If only soldier 2 attacks him, the power of the attack is 1. If only soldier 4 attacks him, the power of the attack is 1 again. If they attack together, the power of the attack is 2. In each of these cases, soldier 1 will live.
Soldier 2 can be attacked by soldier 3, with attack power 4. His shield has defense value 4, which is not enough, so in this case, soldier 2 would die. The best safe choice is soldier 1, with defense value 3.
Example case 2: No soldier is guaranteed to survive the battle, so the answer is −1.

Chef was recently watching Modi Ji's speech and he had a perfect array of integers with him. A perfect array is one in which sum of odd index elements equals the sum of even index elements.
As soon as Modi Ji announced the lockdown, he was shocked and lost one of the elements in the array. So, it is quite possible that the array is no longer perfect.
He needs your help. You are given an array of N integers. You need to add exactly one integer in the beginning of the array so that it becomes perfect.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of test case contains an integer N.
Next line contains N space seperated integers, A0, A1, … , An−1.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the integer value to be added at the beginning of the array.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤103
−105≤Ai≤105

Sample Input:
2
4
1 2 3 4
3
6 1 2

Sample Output:
-2
7

EXPLANATION:
In case 1, after adding −2 at 0th index, the array becomes: [−2, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The sum of odd and even index elements are both equal to 4 now.

Numeros the Artist had two lists that were permutations of one another. He was very proud. Unfortunately, while transporting them from one exhibition to another, some numbers were lost out of the first list. Can you find the missing numbers?
As an example, the array with some numbers missing, arr=[7,2,5,3,5,3]arr=[7,2,5,3,5,3]. The original array of numbers brr=[7,2,5,4,6,3,5,3]brr=[7,2,5,4,6,3,5,3]. The numbers missing are [4,6][4,6].
Notes:

If a number occurs multiple times in the lists, you must ensure that the frequency of that number in both lists is the same. If that is not the case, then it is also a missing number.
You have to print all the missing numbers in ascending order.
Print each missing number once, even if it is missing multiple times.
The difference between the maximum and minimum number in the second list is less than or equal to 100.
arr: the array with missing numbers
brr: the original array of numbers

Input:
There will be four lines of input:

n, the size of the first list, arr.
The next line contains  n space-separated integers arr[i].
m, the size of the second list, brr.
The next line contains  m space-separated integers brr[i].

Output:
Output the missing numbers in ascending order separated by space.
Constraints

1≤n,m≤2 X 105
n≤m
1≤brr[i]≤104
Xmax - Xmin ≤100

Sample Input:
10
203 204 205 206 207 208 203 204 205 206
13
203 204 204 205 206 207 205 208 203 206 205 206 204
Sample Output:
204 205 206
EXPLANATION:
204 is present in both arrays. Its frequency in  arr is 2, while its frequency in brr  is 3. Similarly,  205 and  206 occur twice in arr, but three times in brr. The rest of the numbers have the same frequencies in both lists.

Park Street in Kolkata is famous for its mouth watering sweets. There are a total of N  shops in the market, which are extended over a single street with shops following one another. The shops are enumerated from 1 to N, from left to right. The market is unique in the sense that each shop sells only a single type of sweet. Additionally, no two shops sell the same type of sweet. For convenience, the different types of sweets are numbered from 1 to N.
Though the famous market has been running smoothly for many years, the city Mayor decided to have it completely overhauled and aims to make this famous market great again. So he has issued a tender for the shops, which you happened to grab by using your good offices with the Mayor. The tender specifies that you should decide which type of sweet each shop should sell. You would like to do so, while keeping in mind that buyers like purchasing sweets if adjacent shops sell sweets of similar types, because then they can purchase similar type sweets without wandering around many shops. Formally, you would like to minimize the maximum absolute value of difference between the types of sweets in adjacent shops. Two shops which are numbered i and i + 1 (i < N) are said to be adjacent to each other.
The city Mayor himself is very fond of sweets and has decided to have his own shop in the market too. He has chosen shop numbered S in which he will sell sweets of type Q. For the remaining N - 1 shops, you have to assign which sweets should be sold so as to minimize the maximum absolute difference in the type of sweets in adjacent shops.
Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains three space separated integers N, S, Q, denoting number of shops in the market, the shop chosen by the Mayor, and the type of sweet the Mayor's shop sells, respectively.
Output
For each test case, output two lines.
In the first line of each test case, output the minimum value of the maximum difference in the types of sweets of adjacent shops.
In the next line, output N space separated integers denoting the types of sweets sold in each of the shops. If there are multiple answers, output any one.
Constraints

1 ≤ T, N ≤ 500
1 ≤ S, Q ≤ N

Example
Input:
2
3 2 3
2 1 1

Output:
2
1 3 2
1
1 2

Explanation
Example case 1.The city Mayor has decided to sell sweets of type 3 in the second shop. In the first shop, you can decide to sell sweets of type 1 and that of type 2 in the third shop. In this case, maximum difference in the type of sweets of adjacent shops is 2. There can be one other way of assigning sweets with shops, i.e. sell sweets of type 2 in shop 1 and that of type 1 in shop 3. In this case also, maximum difference in type of adjacent shops is 2. So, you can see that in any case, minimum value of maximum difference in type of adjacent shops will be 2. Hence answer is 2.

A Little Elephant and his friends from the Zoo of Lviv like candies very much.

There are N elephants in the Zoo. The elephant with number K (1 ≤ K ≤ N) will be happy if he receives at least AK candies. There are C candies in all in the Zoo.

The Zoo staff is interested in knowing whether it is possible to make all the N elephants happy by giving each elephant at least as many candies as he wants, that is, the Kth elephant should receive at least AK candies. Each candy can be given to only one elephant. Print Yes if it is possible and No otherwise.

Input
The first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and C, the total number of elephants and the total number of candies in the Zoo respectively. The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.

Output
For each test case output exactly one line containing the string Yes if it possible to make all elephants happy and the string No otherwise. Output is case sensitive. So do not print YES or yes.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ C ≤ 109
1 ≤ AK ≤ 10000, for K = 1, 2, ..., N

                        Sample Output 1
                        





Yes
No


Explanation
Case 1. We can give one candy to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant and make them both happy. Hence the answer is Yes. Alternatively we can give one candy to each elephant and left one candy for ourselves but they again will be happy.

Case 2. Even if we give four candies to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant we will have only one candy left and can not make last elephant happy since he needs two candies for his happiness. Hence the answer is No.

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
There are N students living in the dormitory of Berland State University. Each of them sometimes wants to use the kitchen, so the head of the dormitory came up with a timetable for kitchen's usage in order to avoid the conflicts:

The first student starts to use the kitchen at the time 0 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A1.
The second student starts to use the kitchen at the time A1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time A2.
And so on.
The N-th student starts to use the kitchen at the time AN-1 and should finish the cooking not later than at the time AN


The holidays in Berland are approaching, so today each of these N students wants to cook some pancakes. The i-th student needs Bi units of time to cook.
The students have understood that probably not all of them will be able to cook everything they want. How many students will be able to cook without violating the schedule?
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of students.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the moments of time by when the corresponding student should finish cooking. 
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BN denoting the time required for each of the students to cook.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of students that will be able to finish the cooking.
Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
0 < A1 <  A2 < ... < AN < 109
1 ≤ Bi ≤ 109

Example
Input:
2
3
1 10 15
1 10 3
3
10 20 30
15 5 20

Output:
2
1

Explanation
Example case 1. The first student has 1 unit of time - the moment 0. It will be enough for her to cook. The second student has 9 units of time, but wants to cook for 10 units of time, and won't fit in time. The third student has 5 units of time and will fit in time, because needs to cook only for 3 units of time.
Example case 2. Each of students has 10 units of time, but only the second one will be able to fit in time.

An operation on an array of size nn shifts each of the array's elements 11 unit to the left. For example, if  22 operations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].   
Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d operations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers. 
Input Format:
The    first   line    contains    two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and d (the number of operations you must perform). 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state. 
Constraints:

1≤n≤105 
1≤d≤n 
1≤ai≤106 where ai is the ith element of array   

Output Format:
Print a single    line    of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d operations. 
Sample Input:
5 4
1 2 3 4 5   
Sample Output:
5 1 2 3 4
Explanation:
When we perform d=4 operations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:   
[1,2,3,4,5]→[2,3,4,5,1]→[3,4,5,1,2]→[4,5,1,2,3]→[5,1,2,3,4] 
Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated    values,
which is 5 1 2 3 4.

Once Chef was going through the stuff he has in his basement and to his surprise he found N metal balls, each with different weight. Our Chef who is always searching for a way to earn money has decided to sell these balls to gain free money. To his luck, he has found a dealer who is ready to buy these balls but the dealer has agreed to buy only M number of balls. The dealer has also told Chef that lesser the difference between minimum and maximum weigth of metal balls, more money he gets.
Help Chef find M metal balls that he has to give to the dealer to gain Maximum money.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N which denotes number of metal balls.
Second line of each test case contains N space-seperated numbers that denote weight of each ball.
Third line of each test case contains a single integer N which denotes number of metal balls that the dealer want to buy 

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <=N<= 107
1 <= A[i]<= 1018
1 <= M <= N

Chef is playing with balls of two colours one red and another green.There is a machine named "Chef Game Machine" in which all the balls are kept. Chef Game Machine is having a button which when press, it shuffles and puts all the balls in a row(numbered from 1 to N).One row will contain only one ball.Let's denote red ball with '1' and green ball with '0'.
Game is that one need to find the maximum contiguous length of red balls by replacing at most one green ball in the row after shuffling. Chef can win the game if he finds the correct length of contiguous red balls by replacing at most one green ball
For example after shuffling the arrangement of ball is like this 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0  if you replace green ball at 7th place by red ball then you will get  1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 here maximun contiguous red ball length is 5(from index 5 to index 9 ). 

  Now Chef wants to win every time so he ask you to find the longest contiguous  red balls length after replacing one green ball the row.

 Note : You may or may not replace green ball. 

Input  

 First line of test case will contains T, number of test cases. T lines follows. 
 First line of every test case will contain the length N of the row. 
 Second line will contains N space separated 1s and 0s.
 

 Output  

 Output will print a single integer denoting the maximum contiguous length possible after replacing on green ball.

Chef has a non-decreasing array A of N elements. Since Chef was getting bored in his holidays, he was wondering how many subarrays exist in the array, such that the arithmetic mean (avergae) of the subarray is less than the integer K. As the number of such subarrays can be a lot, Chef is asking for your help to exhaust his curiosity. 

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. A single element is also considered a subarray. For example, [3], [4] and [3, 4, 5] are some of the subarrays of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Two subarrays are different if their start or/and end indices are different. 

 
Input
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers in non-decreasing order A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output
Output one integer, the number of subarrays who has mean strictly less than K. Note that this number exceed the maximum of what a C++ integer can hold. 


Subtasks

1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109 for all subtasks

Subtask 1(10 points): All numbers in the array are the same
Subtask 2(30 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 103, 1 ≤ K ≤ 103
Subtask 3(60 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 106, 1 ≤ K ≤ 109
 
Example
Input:
5 4
2 2 3 5 6 

Output:
9

 
Explanation
 The subarrays are: [2], [2], [3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Meeta wants to give a gift to his friend Manoj on his 19th birthday. She collected NN number of gift-cards. The cost of each card Ci is written on it. Now Meeta decided to play a trick with him. She asked Manoj to pick two subsequent cards LL and RR whose prices have odd number of divisors. If he finds those such cards then Meeta will give him all the cards from range L to R (including both).
Now Manoj wants your help to identity those two such cards so that he can get the maximum number of cards.
If there is no such two cards then Meeta will not give him any card.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, total number of cards N. 
Next line contains of N space-seperated numbers which represents the cost of cards, $Ci$.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of maximum cards which Manoj can get from Meeta if there is no such possibility the output should be 0.

Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
A football competition has just finished. The players have been given points for scoring goals and points for committing fouls. Now, it is up to Alex to find the best player in the tournament. As a programmer, your job is to help Alex by telling him the highest number of points achieved by some player.
You are given two sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN. For each valid ii, player ii scored Ai goals and committed Bi fouls. For each goal, the player that scored it gets 20 points, and for each foul, 10 points are deducted from the player that committed it. However, if the resulting number of points of some player is negative, this player will be considered to have 0 points instead.
You need to calculate the total number of points gained by each player and tell Alex the maximum of these values.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of points.

John likes fighting games a lot. He owns a game called "Fight Club". In this game there are n players playing all the times. Every player has an energy level (Ai). Every day one of the following 2 things happen:

Either one of these players get an energy boost of X, now his energy level increases by X.
Or two players X and Y (with energy levels Ax and Ay) fight against each other and if some player is having energy level strictly greater than the other then he gets all the energy (Ax+Ay) and the energy level of the other player becomes 0. If they have equal energies then it's a draw and nothing happens.


The above game continues for d days. Now you have the information of what happened on each day.

1 i X : ith player gets an energy of X.
2 U V : means the player U and V fight against each other.

After every day you need to print the maximum energy level that any player has (Note that you just need to print energy level, player number does not matter here).
Input

First line will contain 2 integers n and d denoting the number of players in the game and number of days for which the game is played respectively.
Next line contains n integers denoting the initial energy levels of all the players.
Next d lines contain one of the 2 operations mentioned above.

Output
Print d lines with each integer(ith) denoting the Maximum energy level after the ith day.
Constraints

1 <= n,d <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 109
1 <= i, U, V <= n
1 <= X <= 109

Chef likes to play with array elements. His teacher has given him an array problem. But now he is busy as Christmas is coming. So, he needs your help. Can you help him to solve this problem.
You are given an array (A1,A2,A3……AN)(A1,A2,A3……AN) of length NN. You have to create an another array using the given array in the following ways:
For each valid i, the ith element of the output array will be the sum of the ith element and (A[i])th element if A[i]A[i] is less equal N.
Other wise for each valid i following the step below
i) Divide the value of A[i] by 2 untill it will be less thanN.
ii) then find the difference (D) between N and A[i].
iii) the ith element of the output array will be Dth element.  
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.  
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.   

Output:

For each testcase, print new array in each line.

Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a matrix of integers AA with NN rows (numbered 11 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). Each element of this matrix is either 0 or 1.
A move consists of the following steps:

Choose two different rows r1 and r2 or two different columns c1 and c2.
Apply the bitwise OR operation with the second row/column on the first row/column. Formally, if you chose two rows, this means you should change Ar1,k to Ar1,k∨Ar2,k for each 1≤k≤M; if you chose two columns, then you should change Ak,c1 to Ak,c1∨Ak,c2 for each 1≤k≤N.

For each element of the matrix, compute the minimum number of moves required to make it equal to 1 or determine that it is impossible. Note that these answers are independent, i.e. we are starting with the initial matrix for each of them.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains M integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,M NOT separated by spaces.

Output
For each test case, print N lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain M space-separated integers; for each valid j, the j-th of these integers should be the minimum number of moves required to make Ai,j equal to 1, or −1 if it is impossible.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N,M≤1,000
Ai,j∈{0,1} for each valid i,j
the sum of N⋅M for all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of 2 lines.

The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of people at the party.   
Next N lines contain N2 integers of the matrix M, where each line contains N integers.

Output Format:
For each test case, print the id of the celebrity if present. Otherwise, print "-1".
Constraints:

1≤T≤50
2≤N≤3000
M[i][j] = 0 or 1
1≤id≤N

Explanation:
For 1st test case, given matrix M as:
0 1 0
0 0 0
0 1 0
The first row denotes the connection for 1st person and similarly for others. It is clear from the matrix that the 1st person knows only 2nd person. Also 3rd person knows only the 2nd person.
Here, the 2nd person is the guest because every other person knows him and he doesn't knows anyone. Therefore, 2 is printed on a new line.

Chef has an array AA of length NN. He defines the alternating sum of the array as:

S=|A1|−|A2|+|A3|−|A4|+…(−1)N−1⋅|AN|S=|A1|−|A2|+|A3|−|A4|+…(−1)N−1⋅|AN|

Chef is allowed to perform the following operation on the array at most once:

Choose two indices i and j (1≤i<j≤N) and swap the elements Ai and Aj.

Find the maximum alternating sum Chef can achieve by performing the operation at most once.
Note: |X| denotes the absolute value of X. For example, |−4|=4 and |7|=7.
Input Format

The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains a single integer N - size of the array A.
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers - denoting the elements of array A.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line, the maximum alternating sum Chef can obtain by performing the operation at most once.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test Case 1: One optimal way is to perform no operations. Thus the alternating sum is |10|−|−10|=10−10=0.
Test Case 2: One optimal way is to choose i=2 and j=5. After swapping, the array is [−3,1,−1,0,−2,2,3]. The alternating sum in this case is |−3|−|1|+|−1|−|0|+|−2|−|2|+|3|=6.

Read problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is participating in a pogo stick race. In this competition, there are N squares (numbered 1 through N) in a row. Chef must choose a starting square, enter this square and start jumping on his pogo stick. In each jump, if Chef is at a square s, then he can only jump to the square s+K. If square s+K does not exist, Chef jumps out of the row of squares and the race ends for him. It is not allowed to stop jumping any earlier.
Each square has a value; let's denote the value of the i-th square by Ai. Initially, Chef has 0 points. When he jumps in some square (including the initial square), he is awarded a number of points equal to the value of this square, exactly once. Note that if this value is negative, the number of Chef's points is decreased.
Determine the maximum possible total number of points Chef can get if he selects the initial cell optimally.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.

It's Christmas time, Santa's friends are helping him to arrange the gifts. Franklin is a new member of Santa's group and he too help the others in arranging the gifts. Let n be the number of gifts. Santa has a unique technique of ordering ,he put a number on each gift and then he  write the order of the gifts on a piece of paper and give it to his friends .But Franklin being a new member does not know about this technique so he arrange the gifts haphazardly without maintaining the order. But then one of the other member told him about this technique. Franklin finds himself in deep trouble and asks for your help.
You are given the order of the gifts that Santa has given on the paper and also the order by which Franklin arranges the gifts. You have to find the minimum number of swaps required to convert Franklin's order to Santa's. 
Input:
t:  No of test cases
n:  No of gifts
arr: elements written by Santa on the paper
brr: order by which Franklin arranges the gifts  
Output:
t lines containing the minimum no of swaps required to convert brr to arr.  
Constraints:
1<=t<=100
1<=n<=10^5
1<=arr[],brr[]<=10^4  
Sample Input:

4
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3
1 3 2
1 3 2   
Sample Output:
2
0  
Explanation:
1st test case-
If we swap 2 and 1 the array brr becomes [1,3,2,4][1,3,2,4] .Now  we have to swap 3 and 2 hence the array becomes [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4].This the number of swaps is 22.
2nd test case:
Both the arrays are equal. So number of swaps is 00.

Read problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
Chef and Divyam are playing a game. They start with a rational number XX, such that 0<X<10<X<1.
In each turn, Chef chooses a positive real number YY. Then Divyam either adds or subtracts YY to XX. So XX is replaced with either X+YX+Y or X−YX−Y. If this number becomes 00 or 11, then Chef wins. Otherwise, the game continues.
You are given XX, and you have to determine whether Chef can win in a finite number of moves. More formally, does there exist a finite number NN so that Chef has a strategy that is guaranteed to win in at most NN moves?
Here, XX will be given in the form ABAB, where AA and BB are positive integers, A<BA<B and gcd(A,B)=1gcd(A,B)=1.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers AA and BB.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if Chef can win the game in a finite number of moves and "No" otherwise (without quotes). You can print "Yes" or "No" in any case.

Explanation
Test case 1: Chef will choose Y=12Y=12, so whatever Divyam does, the number will become 00 or 11. Hence Chef will win in a finite number of moves. 
Test case 2: No matter what Chef chooses, it can be shown that Divyam can make sure Chef never wins.

Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an array of NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and three more integers X,p,X,p, and k.
An operation on the array is defined to be: replace the k-th smallest integer in the array with any integer you want.
Output the minimum number of operations you must perform on the array (possibly 0 operations) to make the p-th smallest  element of the array equal to X. If it is impossible to do so output −1.
Note: the k-th smallest number in an array is the k-th number from the left when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four integers N,X,p,k respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of operations you must perform to make X the p-th smallest element or −1 if its impossible to do so.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤p,k≤N
0≤X≤109
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 4∗105
0≤Ai≤109 for each valid i

                        Sample Output 1
                        





1
-1


Explanation
Example case 1:

We can perform one operation in the array. Take the k-th smallest integer of the current array (which is 8 in this case) and replace it with 0. The array then becomes [4,9,7,0,0] which now makes 4 as the 3rd smallest number of the array.

Example case 2:

It is impossible to make 25 as the smallest number of the array.

RiggiRiggi   is a spy of KBIKBI and he is on a secret mission, he is spying an Underworld Don  AnitAnit.
Riggi  is spying him since 5 years and he is not able to find  any evidence against Anit. 
KBI told Riggi they will send him a code string in a special format that will inform him whether he  has continue or return back from mission.
According to KBI  firstly  he  has to find what is the original string and then he has to check string is palindrome or not .
If its a palindrome then he has to leave the mission and return back else continue spying Anit. 
Rules to find original string :
1:-If in Code string any integer(N) followed by a string of alphabets that starts with '+' and  ends with '-' then he has to repeat that string N times  , like 3+acg- = acgacgacg.
2:-If there is no integer present before string then print the string is repeated 1 time.
    like bc=bc.
Example of conversion from  Code string  to original string  : 2+ac-3+kb-j=acackbkbkbj  
Input:

Code string S is taken as input  .

Output:

Print  string Continue if code string S is not a palindrome else print Return .

Constraints

1≤S≤1000
1≤N≤1000

Sample Input 1:
3+xy-bb3+yx-

Sample Output 1:
Return

Sample Input 2:
3+xy-bb3+xy-

Sample Output 2:
Continue

EXPLANATION:
Sample 1:- original string will be xyxyxybbyxyxyx which is  a palindrome hence print Return.
 Sample 2:- original string will be xyxyxybbxyxyxy which is not a palindrome hence print

Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
You want to build a temple for snakes. The temple will be built on a mountain range, which can be thought of as n blocks, where height of i-th block is given by hi. The temple will be made on a consecutive section of the blocks and its height should start from 1 and increase by exactly 1 each time till some height and then decrease by exactly 1 each time to height 1, 
i.e. a consecutive section of 1, 2, 3, .. x-1, x, x-1, x-2, .., 1 can correspond to a temple. Also, heights of all the blocks other than of the temple should have zero height, so that the temple is visible to people who view it from the left side or right side.
You want to construct a temple. For that, you can reduce the heights of some of the blocks. In a single operation, you can reduce the height of a block by 1 unit. Find out minimum number of operations required to build a temple.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n.
The next line contains n integers, where the i-th integer denotes hi
Output
For each test case, output a new line with an integer corresponding to the answer of that testcase.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ hi ≤ 109

Example
Input
3
3
1 2 1
4
1 1 2 1
5
1 2 6 2 1

Output
0
1
3

Explanation
Example 1. The entire mountain range is already a temple. So, there is no need to make any operation.
Example 2. If you reduce the height of the first block to 0. You get 0 1 2 1. The blocks 1, 2, 1 form a temple. So, the answer is 1.
Example 3. One possible temple can be 1 2 3 2 1. It requires 3 operations to build. This is the minimum amount you have to spend in order to build a temple.

Assume you're the owner of "XMAS" Factory located in Udyambag, Belagavi. This XMAS Factory is well known for producing high-quality toy cars including Christmas gifts for kids. These toy cars when turned ON moves forward and autonomously navigates. 
There are MM different types of toy cars. Each type of toy car has NN number cars. There are MM number of machines which produce cars of its corresponding type. For example a "Type 1" machine would produce "Type 1" car only. There is only one machine for each type. Each machine has a special button that reverses the logic of the circuit used in the toy car.  For example, if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move forward when turned ON then by pressing this special button on this machine, the car produced would move backward instead of moving forward similarly, if the logic circuit of the car is designed to move backward when turned ON then by pressing this special button on this machine, the car produced would move forward instead of moving backward thus revering the logic. K is the number of machines in which this special button is turned ON.

A car is said to have correct logic if and only if it moves forward when turned ON.
A car is said to have incorrect logic if it moves backward when turned ON.

The factory has produced M*N number of toy cars. Out of which there are some faulty cars produced with incorrect logic. In order to correct the logic, all the cars are put back into corresponding types of machine. If K is the number of machines in which the special button is turned ON (pressed), you being the owner want to know what maximum number of cars could be produced with correct logic.
Input:

First line will contain single integer T indicating the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains 3 integers namely M, N and K where M is the total number of types of toy cars,  N is the total number of toy cars produced in each type, and K is the exact number of special buttons that will be turned ON.
For each of the next M lines, there is a single integer between 0 and N that indicates the number of cars that are with correct logic.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer indicating the maximum number of toy cars with correct logic.
Constraints

1≤T≤20
1≤K≤M≤106
1≤N≤106

Sample Input 1:
    2
    2 2 1
    2
    0
    2 4 2
    0
    3

Sample Output 1:
    4
    5

EXPLANATION:
There are two test cases in this sample test file.
In the first test case, there are two types of cars with each type having in total 2 number of cars. Since there are two types of cars there would be corresponding two types of machines producing it. In the first type say "Type 1", both the cars have correct logic and in the second type say "Type 2", both the cars have incorrect logic. Since K=1, the special button of the "Type 2" machine can be turned ON to correct the logic of both the "Type 2" cars. Hence all the cars can be implemented with correct logic.
In the second test case, there are two types of cars with each type having in total 4 number of cars. Since there are two types of cars there would be corresponding two types of machines producing it. In the first type say "Type 1"  all the cars have incorrect logic and in the second type say "Type 2", 1 car has incorrect logic and remaining 3 cars have correct logic. Since K = 2, the special button on both the machines must be turned ON. As a result, the number of cars with correct logic implemented are 4 from "Type 1" and 1 from "Type 2"

Jumping Jack is new to the Heroic Society.He is so obsessed with jumping that he can do it the whole day without getting tired
Jumping Jack likes challenges a lot, and he is challenged by the beautiful Cho Chang to jump a river.
Since Jumping Jack can't jump the river in a single leap, Cho Chang gave him N magical leaves which will float on water.
Jumping Jack arranged the leaves in a stright line on the water's surface.
The last leaf arraged by Jumping Jack represents the bank of the river. If Jumping Jack can reach the last leaf then it means that 
  can cross the river.

Jumping jack has three different style of jumping which are as follows:

Jump one step forward
Jump two steps forward 
Jump three steps forward 

But there's a twist in the game.Cho Chang unknowingly gave him some pseudo-magical leaves.
If Jumping Jack steps on any pseudo-magical leaf he will drown.
You are given the information about the leaves arranged by Jumping Jack in the form of an array A.
A[i] is Zero if the leaf is magical and One if it is pseudo-magical
Find out whether it is possible for Jumping Jack to cross the river or not,
if YES then the minimum leaps required by him to cross the river.
if NOthen print "Never Give Up" without quotes.
Note: Reaching the last leaf is considered as crossing the river. If Jumping Jack can't reach the last leaf then he can't cross the river
Initially Jumping Jack is standing on the first leaf.

 
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
   The description of T test cases follows.
   First line of each test case contains an integer N
   Second line contains N space separated integers denoting whether the leaf is magical(0) or pseudo-magical(1)
 
Output
For each test case output one single line the minimum number of leaps required to cross the river if it is possible.
  If it is not possible to cross the river then print "Never Give Up" without quotes

In the cursed land of earth where all crops are failing, Tom Cooper is trying to grow n acres of crop this season, and he can grow one crop in an acre. Tom has two sets of n crop seeds each. In the two sets, the two ith crop seeds are the same type crop.
The first set of n crop seeds are independent and each of them require their own preparation and can be grown independently. The ith crop under this category will take a cost of xi.
The second set of n crops are genetically modified to withstand extreme conditions and even withstand the intense dust storms. But there is one thing: to allot a proper usage of resources, the crops are designed in such a way that the ith crop can be directly grown without fertiliser or other resource if the genetically modified (i−1)th crop is grown: that is, for example, the waste material of the (i−1)th crop can be fertiliser for the ith crop, etc. Thus he can grow the ith crop in them in a constant c cost along with a preparation cost of cki but if he has also grown the (i−1)th genetically modified crop, he can skip the preparation cost and grow the ith crop in just c cost.
Since the world market expects a lot of variety in the crops available, Tom wants to maximize the number of different types of crops he grows. That is for example, Tom can grow only genetically modified crop 1 on all his fields. In that case, he grows 1 crop. Tom wants to maximize this number of crops he grows. Note that growing both genetically modified and normal versions of the same crop count as growing 1 crop only, and not 2.
Thus, Tom wants you to find out the maximum number of different crops he can grow, and the corresponding minimum cost at which he can grow n sets of crops.
Input format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains two numbers n and c.
The second line has n integers x1,x2,…,xn.
The third line has n integers k1,k2,…,kn.

Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤n≤104
1≤c≤109
1≤x[i]≤109
1≤k[i]≤10

Output format
For each test case, output a line having two integers - the maximum number of different crops that can be grown, and the minimum cost that'll be taken for this set of crops.

You are given a matrix of characters. The matrix has N rows and M columns. Given a string s, you have to tell if it is possible to generate that string from given matrix.
Rules for generating string from matrix are:

You have to pick first character of string from row 1, second character from row 2 and so on. The (N+1)th character of string is to be picked from row 1, that is, you can traverse the rows in a cyclic manner (row 1 comes after row N).
If an occurrence of a character is picked from a row, you cannot pick the same occurrence again from that row.

You have to print Yes if given string can be generated from matrix using the given rules, else print No.
Input Format:
First line consists of T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of:
First line consists of two integers N and M, denoting the matrix dimensions.
Following N lines consist of M characters each.
The last line consists of a string s.
Output Format:
For each test case, print "Yes" if the string can be generated else print "No". Answer for each test case should come in a new line.

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese,Russian and Vietnamese as well.
The snakes want to build a temple for Lord Cobra. There are multiple strips of land that they are looking at, but not all of them are suitable. They need the strip of land to resemble a coiled Cobra. You need to find out which strips do so.
Formally, every strip of land, has a length. Suppose the length of the i-th strip is is Ni, then there will be Ni integers, Hi1, Hi2, .. HiNi, which represent the heights of the ground at various parts of the strip, in sequential order. That is, the strip has been divided into Ni parts and the height of each part is given. This strip is valid, if and only if all these conditions are satisfied:

There should be an unique 'centre' part. This is where the actual temple will be built. By centre, we mean that there should be an equal number of parts to the left of this part, and to the right of this part.
Hi1 = 1
The heights keep increasing by exactly 1, as you move from the leftmost part, to the centre part.
The heights should keep decreasing by exactly 1, as you move from the centre part to the rightmost part. Note that this means that HiNi should also be 1.

Your job is to look at every strip and find if it's valid or not.
Input

The first line contains a single integer, S, which is the number of strips you need to look at. The description of each of the S strips follows
The first line of the i-th strip's description will contain a single integer: Ni, which is the length and number of parts into which it has been divided.
The next line contains Ni integers: Hi1, Hi2, .., HiNi. These represent the heights of the various parts in the i-th strip.

Output

For each strip, in a new line, output "yes" if is a valid strip, and "no", if it isn't.

Constraints

1 ≤ S ≤ 100 
3 ≤ Ni ≤ 100 
1 ≤ Hij ≤ 100

Output:

Explanation
In the first strip, all the conditions are satisfied, hence it is valid.
In the second strip, it does not start with a 1, and hence is invalid.
In the third strip, it keeps increasing even past the centre, instead of decreasing. Hence invalid.
The fourth strip does not increase and decrease by exactly 1. Hence invalid.
The fifth satisfies all conditions and hence is valid.
The sixth and seventh strip do not have a 'centre' part. Because for every part, there are either more parts to its right than its left, or more parts on its left than its right. Hence both the strips are invalid.

 The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
 The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
 The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.


Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:



Round
Player 1
Player 2


1
140
82


2
89
134


3
90
110


4
112
106


5
88
90



The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:


Round
Player 1
Player 2
Leader
Lead


1
140
82
Player 1
58


2
229
216
Player 1
13


3
319
326
Player 2
7


4
431
432
Player 2
1


5
519
522
Player 2
3


Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
 The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
 Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
 The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
≤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 ≤ Si ≤
1000 and 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000.  
Output
 Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

Little kids, Jack and Evan like playing their favorite game Glass-and-Stone. Today they want to play something new and came across Twitter on their father's laptop.

They saw it for the first time but were already getting bored to see a bunch of sentences having at most 140 characters each. The only thing they liked to play with it is, closing and opening tweets.

There are N tweets on the page and each tweet can be opened by clicking on it, to see some statistics related to that tweet. Initially all the tweets are closed. Clicking on an open tweet closes it and clicking on a closed tweet opens it. There is also a button to close all the open tweets. Given a sequence of K clicks by Jack, Evan has to guess the total number of open tweets just after each click. Please help Evan in this game.

Input
First line contains two integers N K, the number of tweets (numbered 1 to N) and the number of clicks respectively (1 ≤ N, K ≤ 1000). Each of the following K lines has one of the following.CLICK X , where X is the tweet number (1 ≤ X ≤ N)
CLOSEALL
Output
Output K lines, where the ith line should contain the number of open tweets just after the ith click.

Explanation
Let open[x] = 1 if the xth tweet is open and 0 if its closed.
Initially open[1..3] = { 0 , 0 , 0 }. Here is the state of open[1..3] after each click and corresponding count of open tweets.
CLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1
CLICK 2 : { 1, 1, 0 }, open count = 2
CLICK 3 : { 1, 1, 1 }, open count = 3
CLICK 2 : { 1, 0, 1 }, open count = 2
CLOSEALL : { 0, 0, 0 }, open count = 0
CLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1

Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are participating in a contest which has 1111 problems (numbered 11 through 1111). The first eight problems (i.e. problems 1,2,…,81,2,…,8) are scorable, while the last three problems (9, 10 and 11) are non-scorable ― this means that any submissions you make on any of these problems do not affect your total score.
Your total score is the sum of your best scores for all scorable problems. That is, for each scorable problem, you look at the scores of all submissions you made on that problem and take the maximum of these scores (or 0 if you didn't make any submissions on that problem); the total score is the sum of the maximum scores you took.
You know the results of all submissions you made. Calculate your total score.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of submissions you made.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers pi and si, denoting that your i-th submission was on problem pi and it received a score si.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― your total score.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤1,000
1≤pi≤11 for each valid i
0≤si≤100 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (15 points): all submissions are on the same problem, i.e. p1=p2=…=pN
Subtask #2 (15 points): there is at most one submission made on each problem, i.e. pi≠pj for each valid i,j (i≠j)
Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints

135
0


Explanation
Example case 1: The scorable problems with at least one submission are problems 2 and 8. For problem 2, there are two submissions and the maximum score among them is 45. For problem 8, there are also two submissions and the maximum score is 90. Hence, the total score is 45+90=135.
Example case 2: No scorable problem is attempted, so the total score is 0.

JJ challenges his friend GG to construct an array A containing N distinct elements such that the following conditions hold:

For all 1≤i≤N, 1≤Ai≤105
For every subarray of length ≥2, the sum of all the elements of the subarray is not divisible by the length of the subarray

Please help perplexed GG to complete JJ's challenge.
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A to be constructed.

Output Format
For each test case, output an array A containing N distinct elements which satisfy the given conditions.
If there are multiple arrays that satisfy the conditions, print any.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤500

Explanation
Test case-1: Following are the subarrays of length ≥2:

Length=2: sum([7,2])=9, sum([2,5])=7
Length=3: sum([7,2,5])=14 

We can see that for each of these subarrays, the sum is not divisible by the length.
Test case-2: Following are the subarrays of length ≥2:

Length=2: sum([3,18])=21, sum([18,11])=29, sum([11,2])=13 
Length=3: sum([3,18,11])=32, sum([18,11,2])=31
Length=4: sum([3,18,11,2])=34

We can see that for each of these subarrays, the sum is not divisible by the length.

Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese as well.
You are given an array AA with length NN. On each day, the following process was performed:

a new array R is created; this array contains all elements Ai such that i=1, i=N or min(Ai−1,Ai+1)≤Ai (2≤i<N), in the original order
A is replaced by R and N is replaced by the length of R

In other words, all elements of A that are between two bigger elements disappear.
For each element of the original array, calculate the number of the day on which it disappeared (the process starts with day 1), or determine that it never disappeared.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the number of the day on which the i-th element of the original array disappeared, or 0 if it never disappeared.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤105

On a random day, Ayushi came running to her hostel to UN-box her parcel, that she received from an e-commerce website as a gift from an unknown guy. To her surprise, the parcel had a secured case, which prompted her to play a small game to break into the security.
The game was simple.
Ayushi was asked to enter a number N and she had to find the largest number having N digit which is the "Samosa Number".
"Samosa number" is developed by a "Samosa" Lover, that unknown boy.
A number P is a Samosa Number if it follows the following three criteria :
1.The number should consist of the odd digit at the odd positions but starts with an even digit.
2.The number consists of each digit from 1 to N at most once.
3.The number is prime.
Ayushi was not so genius neither a coder, so she came running to you for the code. Are you willing to solve the problem for her, provided she is extremely cute and single, searching for a coder friend.
INPUT
A single integer (1≤N≤8). The number consists of integers from 1 to N but doesn't consist of 0.
OUTPUT
The largest number of N digit that is a Samosa Number.
If it doesn't exist, then output "Dont Exist for N"(Value of N) without the quotes.

Sample Input
2

Sample Output
Dont Exist for 2

Sample Input
4

Sample Output
4231

Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.

You are given an array A with size N and a number K. Let's call a position i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) valid if, after increasing Ai by K, it would be greater than the sum of all other elements in the array A.

Determine the number of distinct valid positions.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid positions.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100,000
1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000
1 ≤ K ≤ 109
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 104 for each valid i
1 ≤ sum of N over all test cases ≤ 100,000

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (33 points): sum of N over all test cases ≤ 5,000

Explanation

Example case 1: A1 + K = 6 isn't greater than A2 + A3 + A4 = 14, so position 1 isn't valid. A2 + K = 5 isn't greater than A1 + A3 + A4 = 15, so position 2 isn't valid. A3 + K = 10 isn't greater than A1 + A2 + A4 = 10, so position 3 also isn't valid. A4 + K = 11 is greater than A1 + A2 + A3 = 9. Therefore, there is only one valid position — position 4.
