Not all classes can be interesting. Some are too boring, and in case of offline classes, it's not always possible to run away too. On another such class, Vaibhav and Atul got too bored and so, they decided to play the same game, but with a twist.
Atul gave Vaibhav an integer array A of length N, and three more integers K, L and C. He asked Vaibhav to form K new arrays of L length from the array A, such that the sum of all integers present in the new K arrays combined should be as maximum as possible. Each new array should be a subarray of array A and any element of array A can be part of at most two new arrays. In total, there can be at most C elements which are part of more than one new array.
As the size of array A can be large, Vaibhav needs your help in the calculation. Help Vaibhav to solve the problem.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines of input, first line contains 4 integers N,K,L,C, as described in the question.
Second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,A3,...,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum possible sum. If it is not possible to form K arrays of size L from array A, output −1.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤104
1≤K,L≤102
0≤C≤102
C≤L
1≤A1,A2,...,AN≤109
Sum of N∗K∗C for all test cases does not exceed 107

Explanation
In the first test case, the best way to choose is to choose indices {{1,2},{2,3},{4,5}}.
In the third test case, there is no way to choose required subarrays.
